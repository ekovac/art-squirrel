  "description": "The first time I saw one was on a Thursday, which in my mind was Tire day.<br>\nThere's a Discount Tire warehouse attached to the mall's southern annex, and the place is gargantuan. It's a four story castle of corrugated tin, the thin walls radiating the fading desert heat after the sun goes down, and its twenty thousand square feet reeking of oiled rubber and pressure washed concrete.<br>\nThe top floor's clouded windows feature a beautiful view of the City of Sin, owing to the fact that the warehouse is perched on a hill high above it. I got to see the sprawl minus the rest of the trappings one would expect from a luxury penthouse, unless you were of a mind to include high rollers as a certain class of rat.<br>\nIt was company I could do without, but they left me alone. I'd often start thinking about a short story by King when I saw them though, Warwick and his sordid nightshift crew battling hordes of vermin in slimy darkness with firehoses and pickaxes.<br>\nThe rats weren't what raised my hackles the most, though. Beyond the warehouse security office, its bank of black and white monitors whose imagery was rendered by cameras twenty years old, was a stygian sort of dark. The last source of light was a buzzing vending machine that promised a cold soda or a bottle of water for three quarters, but when you tried to use it every selection was sold out.<br>\nIt's one of those little mysteries of life: why did the warehouse crew keep an empty soda machine plugged in?<br>\nThe main hall from there led to a catwalk which overlooked the entire place. It was just an abyss until you flicked a grimy switch that usually snarled and sparked for a second two. And then...<br>\nI confess, the view is a little existential. Tires stacked three stories tall, of every shape and size. You had the standard car and truck variety, of course, then things got strange...a little Alice in Wonderland I guess you could say, minus the caterpillar with his screwy pipe blowing smoke rings or the stuttering rabbit.<br>\nSome of them were twice as tall as me, were meant for twenty ton earth movers, their size as scary as it was thought provoking. Others were destined to sheath the rims of semis whose wheels would probably turn more times than the planet in the entirety of its wicked career as a lifegiver before they went bald. Still others were studded, the spiky glints within labyrinth tread shining like small, steely icicles, their sidewalls fuzzy with those weird little forests of rubber bristles whose only purpose seemed to be to showcase newness.<br>\nThey sprawled in a black, waxed ocean, in stacks and rows and chaotic piles, numbering in the thousands, receding away like a gloomy sea whose reefs were steel shelves boasting a  tallness rivaling that of giants and whose islands were pallets mummified in shining shrink wrap.<br>\nI hated it, of course, almost as much as the department stores. Maybe more. I was a fan of 'The Sopranos' at the time. I kept expecting Tony, Silvio and Paulie to step out of the shadows with a fresh battery and jumper cables, demand I pay up.<br>\nI'd made some bad decisions concerning credit cards, recently. In Vegas it's hard to say no to today and just as hard to think about tomorrow sometimes.<br>\nThe thing most disturbing about guard duty in that warehouse though, what stood out above the ambience, the industrial coldness, the feeling of insignificance before what all those tires meant, what they were destined to do and all the places and spaces they would be in the future...well...<br>\nIt was the loneliness. The echo. The awareness, I guess, that your own importance might just be a card trick, a dream sold by a slot machine, the fat cat's wink when you played the lottery.<br>\n\"Special?\" that last seemed to purr. \"Try your luck.\"<br>\nThere were more tires than people in the world, I'm fairly sure, but when you see too many of either in one place the concept of odds gets rather odd.<br>\nIt's the gig most of the guys and gals in my squad hopes for, strangely. You're not required to do anything but haunt the security office, basking in the white light and crackling darkness cast by the banks of monitors. You can bring along a box of Krispy Kremes, a pot of black coffee and a Smart Phone, while away the night to the bone like click of an ancient clock up on a grimy wall. <br>\nThe warehouse can probably take care of itself even without you, after all, the gates are chained up tight, the fences are ten feet tall and crowned in rusty tangles of barbed wire. They've even got dogs who didn't change with the Ace, so long ago, feral and four legged and slathering. They prowl the perimeter in packs.<br>\nSometimes, though, I'll walk the floors just the same. Sometimes I'll call out a 'hello' and it will come back to my ears, back flat as I traverse the halls of rubber and gloom, in otherwordly echoes.<br>\n\"Hello, ooo, ooo, ooo, oo, oo,\"<br>\nSurprising, that you can shiver when it's so fucking hot in there.<br>\nTick and click, that clock of bone up on that wall. You can do more than browse social media or enrich your random knowledge with Google searches. You can write a memoir, true.<br>\nIt's almost time to write about them. I don't know if I will, yet time will tell. Tick and click, and well...<br>\n-",
