&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doctor," droned a mechanized voice, "our scouts have reported that they've <br />
found something in a dig for the objects the Autobots call t-cogs."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And?" rumbled Eggman.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It appears to be a complete Transformer," replied Scan-Ops. "It is colored purple <br />
and has a single red eye. On top of that, it is built like an organic female."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring it here," ordered Eggman. The robots acknowledged and obeyed. It took a <br />
while to dig the Transformer out and transport it back to Robotropolis. Once they got it <br />
back, the robots put the Transformer in a tank and filled it with pinkish, transparent <br />
liquid. "This super fuel will be able to jump start that robot," muttered Eggman. "Initiate <br />
the menta-probing process."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All connections to core processor made," reported Scan-Ops. "Initiating scan <br />
now." The liquid started bubbling as lights flashed in the tank. "Revitalization process at <br />
5%, 10%, 15% and remaining steady. Scan stable." Images, words, and diagrams <br />
started flashing on the main screen. "Project: Thrasher?" asked Scan-Ops.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does a shock wave have to do with anything?" quizzed Eggman.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who's this Sentinel Prime?" asked another robot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doctor!" yelped a robot in a panicked tone. "We are being probed! We have tried <br />
multiple attempts but cannot block the intruder out!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" yelled Eggman. The main screen showed the data that was being <br />
scanned. Plans, images of Sonic and his friends, power readings, schematics, all of it <br />
seemed to be copied to somewhere. After a few minutes, it looked like a camera was <br />
watching them with a pinkish light. They saw some sentences being formed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" read the words. "What happened? Where am I? How long have I been in <br />
stasis?" Everyone turned to see that the Transformer's single red eye was glowing. <br />
"4016?" quizzed the Transformer's internal dialog. "2000 Earth Years? Why was I <br />
abandoned? Even Jhiaxus should have collected the dead. It's only logical." More data, <br />
this time alien in origin, flooded the screen. "So the Autobots won," guessed the internal <br />
dialogue of the Transformer. "That collection of Energon was crucial to the Space <br />
Bridge. In any case, this Energon healing tank has restored me. Draining tank and <br />
exiting." The tank drained and let all the pink liquid out. Once completely empty, it <br />
opened to let the Transformer out. Part of the mask that the red eye was on retracted to <br />
reveal a mouth underneath.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greetings, my lavender lady of alien alloy!" greeted Eggman, going off of <br />
appearances. "I am Dr. Julian Ivo Robotnik, Dr. Eggman, if you will. I am the most <br />
brilliant scientist on Mobius, er, Earth."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So this planet has been renamed," said the Transformer in an intimidating <br />
female bass voice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, yes," gulped Eggman. "I brought you here to see if we can come to some <br />
sort of arrangement. You see, I, too, have had some Autobot trouble. I thought that a <br />
simple reprogramming would bring any robot to my control, but the Autobots have <br />
proved more resilient than I originally hypothesized. If you have met these Autobots <br />
before, then I'm sure a beautiful and powerful lady like yourself can give me the edge I <br />
need to conquer Mobius! If you help me, you may rule by my side, my sweet." The <br />
Transformer just stared.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I find your attempts at flirting and your claims of being a scientist...laughable," <br />
she finally said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pardon?" asked Eggman in a dangerous tone. The Femme wasn't intimidated in <br />
the slightest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've seen your plans against this 'Sonic' creature. I've seen your plans of <br />
conquest," continued the Transformer, "I've seen everything while you were <br />
downloading from my processor. Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your <br />
methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable. You are a poor <br />
scientist, Doctor. I see no logic in forming an alliance with you." She stepped forward. "If <br />
you have met the Autobots, my enemies, then you have seen this particular bit to our <br />
evolutionary process. SHOCKWAVE, TRANSFORM!" The head flipped down into the <br />
chest. The tank barrel on the back went on top of the torso. The arms folded into the <br />
back. The legs split in half and the entire ensemble of steel went down the split on the <br />
legs to make a four wheeled transport for the tank that the femme, Shockwave, <br />
became. Her holo-form appeared as a 6'4 human woman with a white lab coat, a purple <br />
shirt, black pants, short, black hair with some of it covering half of her pale, spectacled <br />
face. The left eye, the one eye that was shown, was red. "If you value your life," warned <br />
Shockwave, "and, logically, you do, stand aside and let me leave your base of <br />
operations unimpeded."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not happening!" snarled Eggman. "Robots, ATTACK!" Eggman's forces fired on <br />
Shockwave, but the shots didn't even stir a hair on her head.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Omni-oscillation frequency field," explained Shockwave. "Adapts to any <br />
frequency of laser shot the instant the generator detects the bolt coming out of the gun. <br />
In robot mode, it covers only a small area. I've set it around an obvious flaw. I presume <br />
you thought my monocular vision would hinder me. In vehicle mode, the effectiveness is <br />
boosted tenfold. Now, stand aside." Shockwave's main gun fired on the wall behind <br />
Eggman and made a gaping hole to the outside of Robotropolis. The alarm had started <br />
blasting as troops surrounded Shockwave. She didn't even flinch. Her gun kept cutting a <br />
hole into the robots and whatever of Eggman's forces escaped was found under foot, <br />
er, under wheel, in Shockwave's case. She escaped, leaving smashed Eggman robots <br />
all over the ruined robot city.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This robot is a menace!" wailed Scan-Ops. "There's no way we can contain her!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps I've approached it from the wrong angle," mused Eggman out loud.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir?" asked Scan-Ops.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have all robots pour over the data we've gotten from Shockwave," he ordered. <br />
"She's a logical lady, perhaps there is something else in that data we can offer her that <br />
would appeal to her logic centers."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood," replied Scan-Ops. All science and technical robots set to work <br />
decoding the data and translating it into English. Eggman grinned.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shockwave managed to enter the woods undetected. She transformed and <br />
tossed a disc onto the ground. A purple holographic projection of a young Rosalind <br />
Franklin appeared. "Sigma," inquired Shockwave, "is this still Earth?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Information: spatial coordinates are accurate," reported the hologram, "but <br />
recent data suggests it is not Earth as we knew it. Reminder: planets have changed <br />
over time. Such an example is Femax."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It would be a logical explanation to anthropomorphized animals coexisting with <br />
the humanoid life forms," theorized Shockwave. "Is there Energon on this planet?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confirmed," reported Sigma.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Satisfactory," replied Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Information: there is too much Energon for even a full scale planetary <br />
occupation force to handle," interjected Sigma. "Field readings are off the scale. <br />
Continued exposure to bipedal form will result in permanent damage."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I must stay in alternate mode for the duration of my stay," remarked <br />
Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Information: your last location was the offsite laboratory in Washington D.C.," <br />
called Sigma. "That laboratory held a Space Bridge to Cybertron."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Correct," conceded Shockwave, "but it may have decayed over time."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Information: parts for a Space Bridge are available on this planet," reported <br />
Sigma. "They should be stable enough to replace old parts that may have decayed <br />
beyond repair."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the homing beacon active?" asked Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confirmed," replied Sigma.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I return to the remains of my old laboratory," declared Shockwave, "I will <br />
examine the Space Bridge. Compile a list of necessary parts as I examine it." <br />
Shockwave transformed and sped off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Chapter 12<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optimus was walking around the base with a data pad in his hands. Jazz saw his <br />
pacing. "Yo, Prime, what's up?" he called. Optimus didn't hear him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Autobots, rise to the challenge!" he muttered to himself. He felt a tap on his <br />
shoulder. Optimus jumped a few meters and whirled around to see Jazz. "Oh, Jazz!" he <br />
gasped, recovering from being startled. "Don't practice stealth on me, man!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dude, if I recall," mused Jazz, "'rise to the challenge' was Sentinel Prime's <br />
rallying cry. You're your own Prime."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," replied Optimus, "but there has to be a rallying cry I can make my own!" <br />
Optimus tapped his cranium, and then had an idea. "Convert and Conquer!" Jazz shook <br />
his head. "Yeah, you're right, it doesn't make sense. We're not here to conquer <br />
anything." He paced a few more times, and then stopped. "Rip it up and ride it out!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dude, that sounds wrong!" gagged Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, it did sound gross," agreed Optimus. "Promise me that you'll never let me <br />
use it!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deal!" promised Jazz. There were a few sessions in which Optimus came up <br />
with a lot of rallying cries. All of them were discarded. One of them resulted in Jazz <br />
slapping Optimus on the back of the head and muttering "racist". After he left, Optimus <br />
rubbed the back of his head. He then went back to his conundrum.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What rhymes with orange?" he asked to himself. After a few hours into <br />
nighttime, Ironhide had come from the shooting range out back. He heard Optimus <br />
mutter "Engines loud and make me proud!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, Prime?" he asked. "You okay, kiddo?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doin' great!" a bleary eyed Optimus slurred. "Let's not be late!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, we don't have anywhere to be," remarked Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nowhere to be sounds good to me..." slurred Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," sighed Ironhide as he picked up the youngest Prime, "how about we take <br />
a little break?" He took Optimus to his quarters.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little break could...could be a mistake," mumbled Optimus. "Um, does <br />
anything rhyme with orange?" Ironhide opened Prime's quarters and got him onto the <br />
recharge berth. The berth lowered a clear canopy and Ironhide left Optimus sleeping. <br />
The bot's dreams, however, were far from peaceful. He woke up on solid space. "...the <br />
Pit?" he asked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is far from that unholy place," called a voice. Optimus turned around to see <br />
a mech with a metal cape, a beard, and a three pronged crown.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alpha Trion?" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the Realm of the Primes, Orion," greeted Alpha Trion.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Realm of the...the Matrix?" quizzed Optimus. "This is the Matrix?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right," confirmed the old mech. "My tool, the Quill, had written something <br />
troubling about the future."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did it write?" asked Optimus. Alpha Trion took out a metallic quill and <br />
tapped the writing end to the floor. The scene changed. It turned into a war torn area <br />
with a red sky, Cybertronian corpses littering the land, and a dark figure looming over it <br />
all with his troops. A purple light started glowing in its chest and red eyes blazed into <br />
Optimus' soul. "Who's that?" he gasped.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I cannot tell," replied Alpha Trion. "The Quill only gives me glimpses of the <br />
future." The figure raised an arm mounted cannon as the purple light took shape. It <br />
formed a symbol that all Autobots feared. While the symbol for the Autobots looked like <br />
a noble face in red, this symbol was an evil face in purple. Optimus' optics widened in <br />
horror.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're not seriously suggesting..." he gulped to Alpha Trion.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their campaign may begin again," said Alpha Trion cryptically. The being fired <br />
and the light from the shot woke Optimus up. He panted a few times, and then his <br />
expression changed to that of noticing the headache he earned trying to come up with a <br />
good rallying cry. He rubbed his head and got out of the recharge berth. He thought <br />
Ratchet would have a solution. He headed to the medical bay and knocked on the door.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's open," grunted Ratchet from inside. Optimus approached and saw Ratchet <br />
hunched over a microscope.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Doc," mumbled Optimus, "what have you got for a processor ache?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't call me 'Doc'," snapped Ratchet. "Let me guess, straining your processor <br />
to the breaking point. A nightmare last night."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both," answered Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some night," muttered Ratchet as he got the necessary Energon capsules for a <br />
processor ache. At that moment, Tails walked in.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Autobots," he greeted.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's morning," murmured Optimus, "but the Council's still out on 'good'."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess wishing you a Happy Forge Day will beget a similar response," remarked <br />
Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Huh?" quizzed Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yep, 151 Earth years ago today, you were forged," confirmed Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forge Day?" repeated Tails. "You mean it's Optimus' birthday?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh yeah," recalled Optimus. "I forgot that little detail."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you forget your own birthday?" asked Tails.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't forgotten," replied Optimus, "I just haven't adjusted to your planet's <br />
calendar."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rough night?" guessed Tails.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, and a rough day yesterday," answered Optimus. "Oh well, today's a new <br />
day."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A new day, and a new adventure," agreed Tails. "Jazz made something called <br />
Energolisis."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the Cybertronian equivalent of coffee," explained Ratchet. Optimus took the <br />
capsules with him to the base's mess hall. He saw Jazz by a coffee machine like <br />
device.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, thanks for the Energolisis," he called.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't say it was for you," countered Jazz. Optimus blinked and saw Ironhide <br />
with a glass cylinder of steaming pinkish blue liquid.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" asked Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bots ever wonder how you got here?" Optimus was being philosophical, but <br />
it went over the team's heads.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came here because you needed to get a court martial off your best friend's <br />
chassis and going to the planet he was on was the quickest way to get information out <br />
of him," answered Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I came here," supplied Jazz, "because someone, now known as Eggman, <br />
was digging up Cybertronian corpses on this planet. Now I can do it without fearing the <br />
council and I manage to see my best friend go off world. You still owe me 60 Shanix on <br />
that bet."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel so loved," said Optimus sarcastically.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm ribbing you, Big Bot," chuckled Jazz. "The Energolisis is for every bot. Happy <br />
Forge Day, Optimus."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks, Jazz," bid Optimus. "It's perfect for the processor ache I have right <br />
now."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stayed up all night coming up with a rallying cry?" asked Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nope," interjected Ironhide. "I managed to drag him to his recharge berth."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, spending all day with rallying cry ideas didn't help," remarked Optimus, <br />
"but that's only one of two reasons."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the other reason?" asked Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I had a pow wow with Alpha Trion," explained Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So those meditation days Sentinel Prime had," quizzed Ironhide, "they were him <br />
talking to the Ancients?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly," confirmed Optimus. "He showed me a glimpse of the future with the <br />
Quill. I was soon taken to a Pit like landscape with Cybertronian bodies strewn about <br />
and a massive army with a figure at the front of it. As the lead figure raised its arm to fire <br />
its weapon, its optics were glowing red and a purple light on its chest became the <br />
Decepticon symbol."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you didn't get away, why?" asked Tails.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tried to," replied Optimus, "but I was frozen and couldn't turn. When he fired, <br />
that's when I woke up."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does it mean?" quizzed Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," muttered Optimus, "but if that future had Decepticons in it, we're in <br />
for a Pit of a time."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If those Decepticreeps are after us," growled Ironhide, "then we need to be <br />
ready for their armies!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ironhide, that's ridiculous," dismissed Optimus. "The Quill only gave Alpha Trion <br />
and I a vague notion of what the future may bring. It may be just one Decepticon <br />
attempting to bring the old Decepticon Empire back. The future is uncertain." At that <br />
point, the alarm went off in the base. Everyone sped to the main monitor and saw Sonic <br />
there with the Scarlet Specter and Cream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's going on?" asked Tails.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Cybertronian signal popped up!" replied Ratchet. "It looks like a G.U.N agent <br />
caught a picture." He saw that the picture was a purple thing. "Increase resolution by <br />
ten." directed Ratchet. The image solidified into a purple tank. "Run possible alt-mode <br />
matches," commanded Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One possible match found," reported the computer. It showed the tank and a <br />
certain one eyed robot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" breathed Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that femme is?" asked Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shockwave," whispered Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shockwave?" asked Bumblebee. "As in, the cruel and vicious Chief Scientist of <br />
the Decepticons, who eats Autobot protoforms for breakfast?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If she deemed it logical," confirmed Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Ultra Magnus said that Megatronus shot her in the head!" protested <br />
Optimus. "How could she be alive?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's possible that Shockwave was merely blinded and she repaired her optic <br />
before going into stasis," guessed Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But who would be stupid enough to wake her up?" asked Bumblebee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter now," replied Optimus. "The point is; we need to stop her <br />
before she wreaks any havoc. Ratchet, what's she doing?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It appears she has a...religious following," answered Ratchet. He stumbled over <br />
"religious following".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bot more obsessed with science than you?" asked Ironhide. He chuckled at <br />
the attempted poke to Ratchet's pride, but it either went over Ratchet's head or he <br />
chose not to dignify it with a response. "But, in all seriousness, why would she need a <br />
religious following?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that an altar for her?" quizzed Cream as she pointed to a construct behind <br />
Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," replied Jazz, "but she could have fooled those people into thinking that it's <br />
an altar."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it, then?" asked the Scarlet Specter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like the framework for a Space Bridge," observed Ratchet. All of a <br />
sudden, there was a knock on the door. Optimus transformed and headed for the door. <br />
He opened it and found a gaggle of Mobians dressed in purple robes and purple <br />
headbands with a red circle in the middle.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er...can I help you?" stammered Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the Lady rain glory on you!" called the leader of the group. "We have <br />
traveled long to build a worthy altar for the Lady and we do request items that would <br />
please the Lady's altar. She requires 20 carbon nano-tube batteries, a trinity engine, <br />
and 5 wind powered electro-stalls." Optimus blinked. He turned inside to see Ratchet <br />
silently saying that giving them those parts is a bad idea.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, my friends," replied Optimus. "I'm afraid I have none of those items. I wish <br />
I could help you, but I can't."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is most troubling," sighed the group leader. "The Lady will be most <br />
displeased. Thank you anyway, kind sir. May the Lady still rain glory on you." The group <br />
left while Optimus shut the door. He glanced at Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those things are part of the stabilization relay for the Space Bridge portal," <br />
Ratchet explained.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Space Bridge knowledge is limited here," remarked Optimus as he <br />
transformed. "Mind explaining?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Space Bridge utilizes wormhole generators to create a hole through space," <br />
elaborated Ratchet, "however, if not stabilized, wormholes become black holes very <br />
quickly before the other end is made. The stabilization relay makes it so that the <br />
wormhole will not decay as rapidly and thus we can control when it closes. This whole <br />
situation gives me a chance to test out the Ground Bridge."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me go there," volunteered Bumblebee. "We need to see what Shockwave is <br />
planning and how we can use the terrain to our advantage, and I'm the best scout in the <br />
Elite Guard."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're also the only scout we have," argued Ironhide. "We can't risk having you <br />
die if you're discovered!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need the experience!" protested Bumblebee. "Come on, Prime, let me go!" <br />
Optimus had to make a decision. If he let Bumblebee go, he runs the risk of being <br />
discovered by the most powerful Decepticon on Cybertron. On top of that, the Ground <br />
Bridge vortex would close on him and kill him. On the other servo, he couldn't exactly let <br />
anyone else, even himself, go, and his organic friends were out of the question.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right, fine Bee," he sighed, "but go quickly through the Ground Bridge and <br />
just observe. Call us the instant you get there. Don't fight until we get there. Do you <br />
understand?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Sir!" confirmed Bumblebee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right," replied Optimus. "Ratchet, do you have the coordinates?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Sir!" answered Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then open the Ground Bridge," ordered Optimus. Ratchet put the coordinates in <br />
and pulled a lever. The machinery started humming and generated a swirling green <br />
vortex. Bumblebee quickly transformed and sped through the portal. After he went <br />
through, the portal collapsed. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay guys," whispered Bumblebee over the comms. "Good news, the Ground <br />
Bridge works. Bad news, I'm a bit too close. Still not close enough for Shockwave to <br />
detect me, but enough to make me worry. I'm going to let you hear what she's saying."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good work, Bee," answered Optimus. What Shockwave said surprised those <br />
that knew her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And so," she preached, "despite the setback from earlier, the altar you are <br />
making is going very nicely. Soon, I shall ascend to the heavens and bring more of my <br />
kind to bring eternal glory to you. Peace be upon you, my children!" The sermon ended <br />
and the crowd left.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was terrible!" muttered Optimus. "It sounded like she was just reading her <br />
lines! She needed to give it some oomph!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ratchet, I need a Ground Bridge," gulped Bumblebee. Shockwave stiffened and <br />
turned her head. "I think she heard me!" yelped Bumblebee. Shockwave turned <br />
completely and walked towards Bumblebee's speaking. "She heard me! Ratchet, I need <br />
a Ground Bridge now!" The portal opened. Bumblebee zoomed through, but not before <br />
Shockwave transformed to see the symbol on his top. She then stuck her right arm out <br />
to the side to have the tank mode's gun wrap around her arm. She leveled her new gun <br />
arm at Bumblebee and fired, but Bumblebee was too fast for her and managed to get <br />
through the portal so it closed behind him. Once he got back, he told the Autobots of the <br />
Space Bridge and how near completion it was.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to keep Shockwave here," declared Optimus. "If she goes back to <br />
Cybertron, the war will begin again! We can't let that happen. Once she's beaten, we'll <br />
hold her in the brig, contact Cybertron, inform them of Shockwave's survival, and have <br />
the council deal with her."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what about the Space Bridge?" asked Ironhide. "We can't let that thing be <br />
finished!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If possible," replied Optimus, "we secure it for ourselves. If not, we destroy it."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's ridiculous!" protested Ratchet. "The Space Bridge is a quick way to <br />
Cybertron! We could use that!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Shockwave manages to turn it on successfully," argued Ironhide, "she'll bring <br />
an invasion force to Mobius. We can't let that happen."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bumblebee, did you get a good look at the Space Bridge's surroundings?" asked <br />
Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did, Sir," answered Bumblebee. He let his spy-bug fly from his wrist and project <br />
a hologram of the Space Bridge and its location. "She's set up shop in a forest clearing <br />
with millions of trees surrounding the place. If Shockwave is as logically minded as the <br />
History Trax say she is, she's probably patrolling the perimeter."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So using the trees is right out," muttered Optimus. "Will bridging in the center <br />
throw her off?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It WILL skew her sense of logic," replied Ratchet, "but she can adapt quickly."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like you and Jazz," continued Ironhide, "she's skilled in Cyber-ninjutsu, <br />
specifically, Five Servos of Doom."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a forbidden skill set," shuddered Jazz. "Prime and I only know how to <br />
avoid its moves, we don't know how to block or utilize it."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we have to tire her out," declared Optimus. "If we get in the middle of the <br />
clearing, we'll make our position known and, if she refuses to back down, rush her and <br />
continue attacking her until she's too tired to stay upright."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sounds like a plan," agreed Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ratchet," directed Optimus, "if Shockwave is as dangerous as history says she <br />
is, we need a medic."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood," replied Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When do we leave?" cheered Sonic, ready for action. Optimus gave a small <br />
laugh before responding.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We didn't invite you," he remarked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus," argued Sonic, "from what I've heard, Shockwave is more dangerous <br />
than Eggman, and in the interests of protecting this planet, I'm coming with you."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand your worries," replied Optimus, "but Shockwave isn't one of <br />
Eggman's Transformers. If you get underfoot, you'll go squish!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I run that risk whenever Egghead has a giant robot for me to send to the <br />
scrapheap," countered Sonic. "Besides, I doubt Shockwave can keep up. Ninja though <br />
she is, you couldn't keep up with my speed, so I doubt she could."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, one: yes, I can!" argued Optimus. "Two...I guess I can let you come with <br />
us."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who said anything about just one coming?" asked the Scarlet Specter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now wait a minute," protested Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shockwave doesn't know anything about me," remarked the Specter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, honestly, not even we do," countered Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I protect this planet like Sonic does, and I'm willing to throw Shockwave for <br />
a loop!" argued the Specter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Specter, I can't risk any more civilians. I'm pushing it with Sonic here!" <br />
protested Optimus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And yet, Sonic is not as skilled as myself. Why let him go and not me?" quizzed <br />
the Specter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not skilled as you?" yelped Sonic. "I protest! I haven't seen you until Christmas! <br />
Even then, it wasn't to fight!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Specter," sighed Optimus, "if you're really insistent on fighting with us, fine! <br />
Ground rules, do not let your guard down. Shockwave will most likely keep us separated <br />
from you, so we can't protect you throughout the entire fight."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I shall endeavor to keep up," assured the Specter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anyone else?!" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually," called Cream, "I need to get home. I promised my mother I would help <br />
her bake cookies today."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We'll bridge you home," replied Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also propose that Tails stays here at the base," suggested Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Why?!" wailed Tails.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I can't operate the Ground Bridge controls on the battlefield," answered <br />
Ratchet. "I assume you watched me operate the controls when Bumblebee went <br />
through?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, yes," replied Tails, "but it only looks simple!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really is as simple as it looks," promised Ratchet. "You've learned our <br />
coordinates system faster than I did in the Academy."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faster than Megatronus," praised Optimus, "and he's a very skilled <br />
Mathematician."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides," continued Ratchet, "if you stay here, you can stay in contact with me <br />
and monitor Autobot life signs so I can quickly give medical attention to those who need <br />
it in battle."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Much as I make fun of him," supplied Ironhide, "he's the best field medic. Any <br />
help a medic can get will improve care immensely for him."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," conceded Tails, "when you put it that way, I guess I really am more <br />
needed here."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are we ready then?" asked Optimus. Everyone nodded in the affirmative. "All <br />
right, Tails, send Cream home. Cream, call us when you get there."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Optimus," said Cream politely. Tails put the coordinates for Cream's <br />
house in and activated the Ground Bridge. Cream stepped through and the vortex <br />
closed. After a few minutes, the comms unit flashed. Jazz took the call.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You've reached Autobot Outpost Omega One," answered Jazz. "This is Jazz. <br />
Who's calling?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me, Cream," replied the caller. "I'm home safe. Mother seemed a little <br />
surprised at how I came home."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We'll explain everything to her later," assured Jazz. "Have fun making cookies. <br />
Jazz, out."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodbye, Mr. Jazz," bid Cream. The call ended.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right bots," called Optimus, "we're on the clock now! Tails, bridge us to <br />
Shockwave's coordinates!" Tails opened the Ground Bridge again. "Autobots, transform <br />
and roll out!" rallied Optimus. The Autobots cheered as they transformed. Once they <br />
did, the Autobots, Sonic, and the Scarlet Specter sped through the portal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Chapter 13<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that Shockwave was put off by the Autobots appearing in the middle <br />
instead of in the trees as logic dictated would be correct. The portal opened right in the <br />
middle of the clearing and threw Shockwave for a loop. She let the main gun go back on <br />
her back (hee hee, pun) and strode towards the team. "Explain the logic behind this <br />
attack and your entrance location," she demanded.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you know the reason behind this attack very well," growled Ironhide. <br />
Shockwave held the surprise for a few seconds, then let it drop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Returning to this planet seems...illogical as well, Corporal Ironhide," she <br />
remarked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's Master Sergeant to you!" snarled Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Promoted, I see," observed Shockwave. "It would be logical, considering your <br />
tenacity."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're under arrest for war crimes, Shockwave," called Optimus. Shockwave <br />
transformed back into tank mode.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Halting my progress at this stage is highly unwise, young Optimus," she <br />
remarked as her holo-form strode towards them. "Much of my 'war crimes' resulted in a <br />
large number of scientific advances. My work on Space Bridges resulted in the smaller <br />
version you've used to get here."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm going to assume someone told you about us," muttered Bumblebee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably Egghead," guessed Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are referring to the fat fool that calls himself a doctor, then yes, Sonic the <br />
Hedgehog," confirmed Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least we gained enough knowledge to know that the Space Bridge you have <br />
there is dangerously unstable!" snapped Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which is why you should let me continue construction unimpeded," replied <br />
Shockwave. "How about a deal, if you help me return to Cybertron, I will surrender all of <br />
my research to the Autobots."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going back to Cybertron, Shockwave," hissed Optimus. He then got into <br />
a fighting stance, "In a stasis cell!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus, wait," called the Specter, "maybe we should reason with her. One <br />
Cybertronian can't do but so much damage."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know the kind of damage she can do," countered Ironhide. "She may <br />
keep her promises, but only as long as needed."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides," supplied Optimus, "I'm not in the habit of making deals with war <br />
criminals." He turned to Shockwave. "You're coming with us, whether you like it or not!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clearly you Autobots still lack a sense of logic," remarked Shockwave. "You've <br />
heard of my reputation as a powerful fighter as well as a brilliant scientist with only one <br />
loss to my name, and yet you still wish to fight me with the odds stacked against you? <br />
How illogical." She transformed and charged at the team. Everyone got out of the way <br />
except Optimus, whose vehicle mode and holo-form were knocked aside. The Autobots <br />
transformed with Optimus' optics still spinning until he shook his head.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ironhide, you weren't kidding when you said she was powerful!" he gasped. He <br />
jumped to his feet. "Open fire!" he ordered. The Autobots brought down the laser fire <br />
and the Scarlet Specter cast red magic bolt after red magic bolt. Shockwave was not <br />
one to let herself get hit, so she got out of the way and managed to knock Ironhide into <br />
the ground. She then used an afterimage technique to throw off those that weren't <br />
Cyber-ninjas. She didn't count on Optimus and Jazz being skilled in Cybertronian <br />
martial arts as well. The afterimage is created when a bot goes at speeds that are <br />
considered impossible to create an image of itself that seems solid but can't be struck <br />
down. The path can be predicted; it just takes some time. Optimus and Jazz took a few <br />
seconds and managed to both give Shockwave an uppercut. Shockwave spun a few <br />
times in the air before landing on her hands and getting her feet back on terra firma. <br />
"Bet you can't limit your afterimage to limbs!" taunted Optimus. ...That was a mistake. <br />
Shockwave ran up to Optimus and made an afterimage with her fist, but it struck <br />
Optimus in five different places almost instantaneously.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think is the basis for Five Servos of Doom?" remarked Shockwave <br />
as Optimus dropped to the ground in pain. She picked up the Prime and tossed him <br />
aside like a rag-doll. Tails informed Ratchet that Optimus' life signs were dwindling, so <br />
Ratchet rushed to deliver first aid. His progress was interrupted by a flying Ironhide <br />
heading towards him. They were both knocked into each other and then they landed <br />
near Optimus. Shockwave picked up Jazz by the leg and used him as a club to knock <br />
Bumblebee and Cliffjumper into the growing pile of Autobots. Jazz was dizzy, but not <br />
down. He got out a set of blue, glowing, metal nunchaku and whacked Shockwave in <br />
the face with it. Shockwave let Jazz go as her hand instinctively went to her face. She <br />
was a little dizzy, which allowed Jazz to get another nunchaku. Shockwave shook her <br />
head to clear it and focus on her target. She stared at Jazz for a few seconds until she <br />
spoke. "You bring a pair of clubs on wires to a fight," she observed as she crossed her <br />
arms in front of herself. "An error." Long blades extended from her wrists. She started <br />
swinging her blades and delivered a blow to Jazz that cut into his legs. Jazz dropped to <br />
the ground and clutched his knees. Shockwave then tossed him into the rest of the <br />
Autobots. She had assumed that the natives of Mobius couldn't fight back, her error. <br />
Sonic spin-dashed the back of her head and gave her a bit of a processor ache. The <br />
Scarlet Specter then used her magic to lift rocks out of the ground and toss them <br />
towards her face. Shockwave dodged the majority of the rocks, caught a few, and <br />
tossed them at the Specter. Shockwave then transformed, charged at the Specter, and <br />
managed to knock the wind out of her. Sonic charged at Shockwave who simply <br />
backhanded him into the ground. "Your futile attempts at heroism are noted," mused <br />
Shockwave, "but ultimately useless. I have created a large number of weapons and <br />
upgrades in my day. All Autobots fell at my hands. I shall continue building my Space <br />
Bridge," she transformed and leveled her gun arm at the heroes, "after I take care of <br />
eight robo-gnats."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shockwave, wait!" called a voice. It almost sounded like a metallic bass voice. <br />
Everyone turned to see something dressed in the robes of her followers. It moved <br />
towards the group with mechanical sounds every time the thing took a step.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It...can't be...," groaned Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, but it is, my loathsome copy," replied the creature. It pulled back its hood to <br />
reveal a robot's head built like Sonic's. The robot appeared battered, showing bits of its <br />
insides. It originally had five fingers on each hand, but it lost its left hand and had a <br />
severely damaged right hand. Its optics were red against a black background. <br />
"Greetings, Sonic and Company," bid the robot. "Long time, no see."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Metal Sonic!" hissed Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of Eggman's robots?" asked Jazz. Metal Sonic heard that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do people say that?! Do I look like of Eggman's puppets to you?!" he <br />
roared.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But didn't he...?" quizzed Sonic before Metal Sonic's rant interrupted him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just don't understand! Don't compare me to that fat fool!" continued Metal <br />
Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did you stop me?" asked Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You believed that the Autobots came here via a Space Bridge themselves," <br />
guessed Metal Sonic, "and so wanted to terminate them so you could steal the last bit <br />
for your Space Bridge without any problems."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Correct," confirmed Shockwave, finding the conversation refreshing as she was <br />
talking to someone who also use logic on a frequent basis.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm afraid you were misled," countered Metal Sonic. "The Autobots came here <br />
via some sort of stasis pod. I had the footage taken from G.U.N. when they arrived. I still <br />
can't figure out the reason why."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stasis pods?" quizzed Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some jack-hole was digging up the resting places of the soldiers that fought in <br />
the war," explained Jazz. "I came here to investigate."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It wasn't through official channels," supplied Optimus, "but Jazz already tried <br />
that and bureaucracy got in the way. When the Council threatened to give him a court <br />
martial, I took a team of Autobots to get an explanation from him. He gave it willingly, <br />
without guns, and the Council allowed us to give the fallen warriors proper rites. The <br />
portal you saw was the opening for a Ground Bridge instead of a Space Bridge."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have quite a bit of ground to cover if you want to properly bury the dead," <br />
remarked Shockwave. "No matter. You will have enough time to do so. Instead of killing <br />
you here and now, I shall strand you on this planet. You will be restrained so you don't <br />
interfere in my completion of the Space Bridge." She turned to Metal Sonic. "However, <br />
there is one bit of unexplained logic. Why tell me this? What do you want in exchange?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want off this organic infested mud ball!" snarled Metal Sonic. Shockwave was <br />
puzzled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" she asked. "Weren't you built by an organic?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I hate it!" he snapped. "Eggman thinks his chaotic acts will achieve victory. <br />
His strategies are the worst possible ones. They're inefficient, unreliable, and above all, <br />
time wasting! I want peace, harmony, efficiency, and the immortality that comes with <br />
being a machine. If something breaks, a machine will replace it with ease. Constant <br />
change, constant upgrades, constant programs, all of these are the future of this planet, <br />
but it can only happen with your people's technology, not Eggman's." Shockwave <br />
considered his words.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unlike Eggman," she replied, "you use facts to successfully sway me. One <br />
condition, once you've conquered the planet, I want a quiet place on this world for me to <br />
conduct my experiments."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With your technology," offered Metal Sonic, "I will bring test subjects from across <br />
the universe for you. I know of a good place for scientific achievements."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we have a deal," affirmed Shockwave. They were about to shake hands <br />
when a strange whirring noise reached their audio receptors. They turned to see the <br />
Space Bridge activating. "No, not now!" wailed Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't even touch anything!" yelped Metal Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, but I did," said a raspy, growling voice. "Team Dark, attack!" Team Dark <br />
then jumped from behind the Space Bridge controls and charged at Shockwave and <br />
Metal Sonic. Shockwave got out of the way and Metal Sonic jumped over them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You intellectual dwarves!" shouted Shockwave. "Do you realize what you've just <br />
done?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Removed the power source while turning it on," remarked Shadow as he <br />
managed to fish out the purple Chaos Emerald. "The energy should destroy the <br />
apparatus."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow," gulped Optimus, "I have to agree with Shockwave here."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" quizzed Shadow. He got his answer as the Space Bridge started making <br />
its portal. It turned green for a few seconds, then its color turned purple and black.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"BLACK HOLE!" yelped the Autobots, Sonic, and the Specter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks to you," roared Shockwave over the noise, "we'll all die by its intense <br />
gravity well!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would not be too quick in calling the thing a black hole!" shouted Metal Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elaborate!" demanded Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm detecting energy coming out as well as being sucked in!" answered Metal <br />
Sonic. "To my knowledge, black holes only suck things and energy in!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Something's not right here!" realized Shockwave. Metal Sonic turned to Omega <br />
and immediately grabbed his shoulder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you test this thing out for us, defect!" he snarled. He started pushing <br />
Omega towards the Space Bridge vortex. Omega turned and started pushing back.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All you're doing," assured Shockwave, "is testing out whether this is a black hole <br />
or an unstable wormhole! Science will salute your sacrifice!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think Omega wants his sacrifice to be saluted by actual life instead of applied <br />
mathematics!" called Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"AUTOBOTS! FIRE!" ordered Optimus. The Autobots started emptying their <br />
weapons of ammo. Optimus' gun surprised Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand!" she protested. "That thing is the Cybertronian equivalent of <br />
a flintlock! It only has a charge for twenty shots! You must explain how you can fire <br />
forty!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's magic! I don't have to explain it!" called Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you call magic," shouted Shockwave, "I call unexplained science!" She <br />
started firing on the Autobots. Meanwhile, Omega and Metal Sonic were still grappling <br />
with each other.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why call me defective?" asked Omega. "I have no wounds on my shell, unlike <br />
you!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And yet, you let organics be your master!" snarled Metal Sonic. "You blindly <br />
follow a meat sack's orders! How's that working out for you in the long run?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pretty good, actually!" Omega argued. He gave Metal Sonic an uppercut that <br />
made him go up off the ground and start flying to the Space Bridge. Shockwave caught <br />
him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said we would have a joint empire," she promised, "and I mean what I say!" <br />
She was holding onto the controls of the Space Bridge. Optimus saw that opportunity <br />
and fired at Shockwave's hand. Her feet weren't on solid ground, so she was sucked <br />
into the portal with Metal Sonic. The threat of Shockwave and Metal Sonic was over, but <br />
there was still the matter of an unstable Space Bridge.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ratchet," Optimus shouted over the noise, "how do we close this thing?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need to make an explosion in the portal that's greater than the portal's <br />
energy itself!" answered Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would the generator make a big enough explosion?" asked Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should!" called Ratchet. "We just need to time its detonation right!" He then got <br />
an idea. "Optimus! Jazz! Ironhide! Get to the generator! Bumblebee! Cliffjumper! Ready <br />
your weapons and aim at the portal! Sonic! Miss Specter! Team Dark! Get behind me!" <br />
The people got into position. "Optimus, Ironhide, and Jazz, when I say 'toss', throw the <br />
generator into the portal! Bumblebee and Cliffjumper, when I say 'shoot', shoot the <br />
generator! Everyone got it?" The Autobots confirmed. "All right, toss!" The Autobots at <br />
the generator ripped it out of the ground and threw it at the portal. "Shoot!" Bumblebee <br />
and Cliffjumper fired. The generator's explosion tore into the Space Bridge apparatus <br />
enough for all the pieces to fly into the portal. All that was left was a small teal orb of <br />
light. "HIT THE DECK!" shouted Ratchet. Everyone went as flat as they could on the <br />
ground. The orb exploded and gave off a lot of force. It lasted for 10 seconds until the <br />
force had died down. Everyone picked themselves up to examine the area. The damage <br />
was a ring of flattened trees, battered Autobots, and frazzled Mobians.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whooo!" said Optimus weakly as he twirled his arm into the air. He then <br />
collapsed onto the ground.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Tails bridged them back, the Autobots were all in the med-bay. Optimus <br />
had a metal torso cast on him, Jazz had a relief pack on his head to relieve the <br />
processor ache, Ratchet had a metal cast on his lower arm which allowed him to still do <br />
work like putting the head patch on Ironhide, Bumblebee had a metal cast on his right <br />
leg, and Cliffjumper had a neck brace. "Well," mused Optimus, "all in all, it could have <br />
gone worse."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Could have gone worse?!" protested Cliffjumper. "Shockwave nearly decapitated <br />
me while swinging Jazz around like a club! Then she went all Cyber-ninja on us! I can't <br />
even process how we survived!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't yell," groaned Jazz as he rubbed his temples.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the plus side," countered Bumblebee, "Shockwave couldn't have survived <br />
the explosion, a lot less to tell the Council, and we don't need to worry about a Sonic <br />
style Ultron."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that's 'score one for the good guys'," mused the Scarlet Specter. <br />
Shadow stepped in.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which I and my superiors are inclined to agree," he rasped. "We're just satisfied <br />
that a threat to this planet was taken care of quickly."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I assume G.U.N. has secured the clearing?" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And told Shockwave's followers about what happened," continued Shadow. <br />
"Some believed us, some didn't, all were evacuated. We have protocols for this sort of <br />
thing."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The government has protocols for dealing with a Decepticon playing god to <br />
other people?" asked Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course we do," remarked Shadow, "we're the government. We managed to <br />
keep an eye on things for a while. We're just doing a preliminary sweep to find that <br />
Chaos Emerald that was powering the Space Bridge. In the meantime, Team Dark is <br />
going to enjoy a nice, long debriefing."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," chuckled Optimus, "have fun with that."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That reminds me," recalled Shadow, "General Silverwing wants a full report from <br />
you guys."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Really shouldn't have run my mouth," sighed Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look forward to hearing your report," smirked Shadow. He then got out the <br />
green Chaos Emerald and was about to use Chaos Control until Tails came in looking a <br />
little terrified.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whoa!" yelped Sonic. "You okay, little buddy?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, no," stammered Tails. "I helped G.U.N. do a sweep of the <br />
clearing."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We didn't miss anything, did we?" asked Shadow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," replied Tails, "to answer that, the Chaos Emerald went into the portal."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we're down a Chaos Emerald," sighed Sonic. "At least it frustrates Eggman's <br />
plans."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Sonic," argued Tails. "It went through the portal."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That portal was a black hole though," reminded Optimus. "Sonic's right, we're <br />
down a Chaos Emerald."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Optimus," countered Tails, "that was no black hole."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" yelped Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was an unstable wormhole, held together by the Emerald's power," clarified <br />
Tails.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then where are Shockwave and Metal Sonic?!" snarled Shadow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I'm not sure," answered Tails. "My best guess is that they went to an area <br />
that's hidden from our sensors."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great," moaned Optimus. "Just peachy! Now we've got a psycho Decepticon <br />
Femme running around the planet with a robot Sonic on top of Eggman doing some <br />
grave robbing!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This just gets better and better!" hissed the Scarlet Specter. "I must go. If <br />
Shockwave can cause damage to the planet, the other witches of my order must be <br />
informed." She disappeared in red smoke.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to go too," rasped Shadow. "CHAOS CONTROL!" He disappeared in a <br />
flash of green light.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By the Allspark," swore Optimus, "we're never gonna catch a break."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You forgot to mention that rogue Autobots are coming," reminded Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks for the reminder!" snapped Optimus. "Well, looks like we're in for a Pit of <br />
a time."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Chapter 14<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purple portal opened up in the middle of a spire shaped like a perfect <br />
heptagon. Just like the matter it sucked up, its depositing of said matter was far from <br />
graceful. Shockwave and Metal Sonic were practically thrown into the wall. They stayed <br />
there for a few seconds after the portal closed, then slid down slowly. "Not my most <br />
graceful of landings," groaned Shockwave. "Are we in the Well of All Sparks? I must <br />
say, the afterlife is not how the Covenant describes it."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This isn't the afterlife," answered Metal Sonic. "It's a cathedral that serves as <br />
cover for my underground base of operations. I'm surprised we're alive. I thought your <br />
enemies said it was a black hole. Must be the Emerald's doing." Metal Sonic then <br />
remembered. He then fished out the purple Chaos Emerald. "Speaking of which, I have <br />
a nice power source."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why a cathedral?" asked Shockwave. "I never took you to be religious."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm slightly religious," explained Metal Sonic. "I view organics as heathens to my <br />
gods, order, harmony, purity, and logic."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you view a cathedral like this to be a symbol of order?" continued <br />
Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The design is orderly," replied Metal Sonic. "In 3227, the Echidna elders decreed <br />
the place to be built first so the city can be built around it. They wanted everyone to be <br />
equally close to the gods. I like that; the geometry of belief."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought they lived on Angel Island," recalled Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This was before Angel Island," elaborated Metal Sonic. "You see; this spire is <br />
just one of seven spires forming a perfect heptagon with a dome in the center. The <br />
Chaos Emeralds would originally sit on top of the spires while the Master Emerald <br />
would be suspended inside the dome. Too many church robbers came to the city to <br />
take the Emeralds, so the Echidnas took them, found a patch of land for them to live on, <br />
made an altar for the Emeralds, and raised that bit of land to become Angel Island. <br />
Under this rock, I built my own church, one of steel and wires and codes."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eggman would probably say he built you too well," mused Shockwave. "You act <br />
like the next step in Mobius' evolution."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone creates what they dread the most," remarked Metal Sonic. "Those <br />
who seek order beget chaos, peacekeepers make engines of war, conquerors form <br />
avengers, people create...smaller people? Er..."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children?" asked Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children!" confirmed Metal Sonic. "I lost the word for a second there. Children; <br />
designed to supplant the old, to help them...end."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's your goal?" inquired Shockwave. "To end the biological life-forms of <br />
Mobius?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To repair the world," answered Metal Sonic. "Also...yeah." He then pressed a <br />
button on his wrist and they teleported to an underground base full of other Metal <br />
Sonics. "I would offer you the door," joked Metal Sonic, "but my doors aren't built for <br />
robots of larger stature than mine."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What intrigues me the most is that you're a hive consciousness," remarked <br />
Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," called one of the Metal Sonic clones, "so you found my hive code."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours is a bit...simplistic...compared to what I've worked on," explained <br />
Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't exactly have the resources you had back then," answered the first body, <br />
Metal Sonic Prime. Shockwave had to agree. She then noticed tubes full of battered <br />
Metal Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Previous bodies?" she asked. "I suppose I see the logic behind it. You wish to <br />
keep track of whatever was wrong with the other bodies to make a far superior one."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Believe it or not," replied Metal Sonic, "this battered form is 7.0. 8.0 was just <br />
completed when we arrived." He strode over to an empty tube.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've looked through your files," answered Shockwave, "and notice that Sonic is <br />
your priority. Eggman's files showed that the hedgehog is tenacious and yours say that <br />
he's also a master of all seven Emeralds."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which we're going to use against him," planned Metal Sonic. "Ultimately, he will <br />
fall. I have what Sonic and his biological ilk don't; harmony. Even Eggman's empire is <br />
discordant, disconnected, and decentralized. However, even he and Sonic teamed up to <br />
defeat me, once or twice." He stepped into the tube. "Sonic, in particular, has wounded <br />
me. I give him full marks for that. But, as the saying goes, what doesn't kill you," Metal <br />
Sonic's eye went dark and a completed, streamlined form strode forward and closed the <br />
tube, "just makes you stronger," completed the new Metal Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How will we use the emeralds against Sonic and the Autobots?" asked <br />
Shockwave. Metal Sonic was about to reply before she started twitching and sparking <br />
involuntarily. She then transformed into vehicle mode and the sparking and twitching <br />
stopped.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The Hell was that?!" yelped Metal Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Energon field build up," gasped Shockwave. "There's too much of my main fuel <br />
source, Energon. The radiation it puts out is off the scale, so it makes me short out."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Energon?" quizzed Metal Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A blue crystal with raw power in it," explained Shockwave. "Once refined, it is a <br />
Transformer's lifeblood and ammunition."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see," realized Metal Sonic, "the Energon is giving off so much power that you <br />
overload on it."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In robot mode, yes," elaborated Shockwave. "In vehicle mode, I run internal <br />
repairs to sort out any damage to my systems. I need parts to build an Energon shield <br />
so I can stay in robot mode indefinitely while in a base of operations."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any parts that can be manufactured here?" asked Metal Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," replied Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then give me the list of parts and assembly instructions," offered Metal Sonic, <br />
"and we'll build it. Priority one should be having my ally at 100%." Shockwave saw the <br />
logic and complied. After a brief review of the list, Metal Sonic's drone bodies got to <br />
work. Plans are being laid down, my friends. What unholy monster will be...? Oops, I <br />
said too much.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Chapter 15<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratchet was called up to the Space Colony ARK. It had been a week after the <br />
fight between the Autobots and Shockwave and endless combing of the planet has <br />
yielded no results so far. Optimus decided to learn how Shadow uses his signature <br />
chaos move-set, so he practiced on the ARK with the red emerald the Specter gave him <br />
on Christmas. Ratchet was on standby for the attempts. Shadow was tinkering with the <br />
controls of a machine on the ARK when Ratchet appeared via Warp Ring. "You bots <br />
ready?" asked Shadow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On standby when needed," reported Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's do it!" declared Optimus with a grin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Safety fields engaged," relayed Shadow. "Whenever you're ready, Optimus." <br />
Optimus had the red Chaos Emerald in his hand and was concentrating on the other <br />
end of the room.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"CHAOS CONTROL!" he shouted. Instead of warping to the other side of the <br />
room, however, a small orb of yellow light practically threw him to the other side of the <br />
room. He crashed into the wall, backside first.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus!" shouted Ratchet. "Are you okay?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel like a barrel full of fairy kittens!" said Optimus in a loopy tone. Shadow <br />
turned the safety shields off as Ratchet helped Optimus back onto his feet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's the third attempt in a week," sighed Shadow. "Maybe you aren't Chaos <br />
sensitive and we should abandon this line of research."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not ready to call it quits yet, dude," countered Optimus as he massaged his <br />
head and recalibrated his gyroscopic systems. "It took me forever to learn how my <br />
magic weapons work and it probably took you the same amount of time to teleport <br />
yourself across a room, much less three people across a planet. Speaking of which, <br />
have you seen Rouge and Omega? I haven't seen them since the fight with <br />
Shockwave."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They're on a mission in Spagonia," rasped Shadow. "The details are classified. I <br />
can get a Tech wing there if you need them."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just wanted to know where they were, that's all," answered Optimus. "Besides, I <br />
need the Tech wings working on the new Sky Spy. Those two are like wizards, they'll <br />
appear when the situation calls for it." He straightened out his back with Ratchet's help. <br />
"Anyways, we need to focus on building new weapons. When Shockwave and Metal <br />
Sonic show their mugs again, I want the combined arsenal of the Autobots and G.U.N. <br />
at its pinnacle. On that note, any peep from Shockwave or Metal Sonic?" He had asked <br />
this to both Shadow and Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tails and I haven't found them," replied Ratchet. "We're using another <br />
monitoring tactic."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"G.U.N. hasn't found them either," supplied Shadow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slag it!" cursed Optimus. "I thought for sure we'd find them if we used <br />
Shockwave's spark signature as a reference. The fact that she's able to hide it is <br />
worrisome enough, but we don't know the full extent of her or Metal Sonic's abilities."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate to say, 'I told you so,' but I told you so," rasped Shadow. "You should have <br />
just let Shockwave go through the Space Bridge and then destroy it."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One," countered Ratchet, "we have a Space Bridge platform of our own on <br />
Cybertron, deep in Decepticon Central, aka Kaon. She could have hijacked that end <br />
and turned it here to send a whole invasion force to take over the planet. Two, <br />
Shockwave would have set up defenses to keep us from destroying the one she built on <br />
Mobius."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides," remarked Optimus, "if we didn't meet Shockwave, the N.E.S.T. <br />
division wouldn't have been formed."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was the acronym again?" asked Ratchet. "My neural clusters aren't what <br />
they used to be."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty," grunted Shadow. "And G.U.N.'s <br />
been enriched so far in this alliance! How many times have things blown up in our face <br />
whenever you let us examine your weapons?!" Optimus blinked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Someone's a bit tetchy today," he observed..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah," muttered Shadow, "I don't know what's going on, but I feel like something <br />
is whispering in my ear."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Considering your unique genetics," remarked Ratchet, "I wouldn't be surprised if <br />
a small remnant of the Black Arms was trying to get into contact with you. It probably <br />
isn't, but I don't want to run the risk. Let's do a full check up and see if anything's out of <br />
the ordinary for you."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood, but it doesn't feel like the Black Arms," replied Shadow. "Their <br />
method of controlling things requires a non-rhythmic sound. This one is rhythmic."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hm," mused Ratchet. "If it's rhythmic, it could be mechanical in origin. It might be <br />
Shockwave trying something. The fact that you're able to resist shows that she's <br />
functioning on limited resources. Remind me to mention that at our next conference with <br />
G.U.N."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe," growled Shadow, "but all I hear is the whispering."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Better for Ratchet to check," replied Optimus. "The last time I didn't listen to a <br />
doctor, I ended up being carried away on a stretcher with a neck brace and an I.V."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a cycle," yelped Ratchet, "Red Alert told me about a patient who didn't just <br />
take the I.V.! That was you?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" asked Shadow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," muttered Optimus, "that was a few years after I became the new Prime. A <br />
disgruntled Decepticon didn't want an Autobot as Prime, so he set up a bomb designed <br />
to snuff out my spark. It failed, obviously, but I was pretty banged up. Red Alert was in <br />
the area, so she responded quickly."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'You're leaking Energon,' she revealed. 'We need to set up an I.V. and get you <br />
to a hospital.'"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I.V.?' I asked. 'This is just a cut, barely a boo-boo.' I saw the needle and it was <br />
long. 'Whoa! Lady! Ain't that overkill?!'"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'This is protocol,' she sighed. 'Now shut up and sit still. This is no time for <br />
belonephobia.'"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'You know,' I gulped, 'I'd prefer no I.V.'s. Seriously, get that thing away from me.' <br />
My hand covered the wound on my arm."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Optimus, do not test me right now,' snarled Red Alert. 'Move your hand!'"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I'm Prime, and I say no way!' I yelped as I backed away."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Well, I'm the doctor,' she hissed, 'and my authority in medicine supersedes your <br />
authority whenever you're a patient!' She tried to stick me quickly, but I kept her at bay <br />
with my non damaged hand."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'You're crazy!' I shouted. 'I'm not letting you stick me with that!'"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Stop acting like a slagging sparkling!' roared Red Alert. 'We can do this the <br />
easy way or the hard way!'"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Well, it's gonna have to be the hard way,' I foolishly said, 'because you're not <br />
poking me with that thing!' Red Alert put the needle away and...man, she can really <br />
swing a right hook! I ended up being taken to the hospital in a neck brace and on a <br />
stretcher on top of the I.V."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A medic punched you?!" gasped Shadow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We do what we can to administer first aid," remarked Ratchet. He turned to <br />
Optimus. "I hope you learned a lesson that day."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never argue with a medic, they're above even a Prime whenever first aid is <br />
involved," answered Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly," confirmed Ratchet. "Speaking of which, your physical eval is up after I <br />
look over Shadow."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood," replied Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Chapter 16<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Optimus was given his physical, Ratchet released him and it was another <br />
day of sensor sweeps for Shockwave and Metal Sonic. The Autobots were getting <br />
restless. "Anything?" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," replied Ratchet. There was a few minutes' silence.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about now?" quizzed Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus," hissed Ratchet with a little less patience, "you will be the first to know <br />
if I find something." There was a longer silence. A few minutes later, someone crept up <br />
on Ratchet and tapped his shoulder. Ratchet groaned as he guessed who the finger <br />
belonged to. "Would someone keep him occupied so I can get some work done?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Optimus," called Bumblebee, "can I talk to you?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about?" mumbled Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That rallying cry you used last week," replied Bumblebee. "The Autobots and I <br />
have been talking and we like that one."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Transform and roll out?" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's the one," confirmed Bumblebee. Optimus considered.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bumblebee's right," called Ratchet, "it's short and simple. That's the mark of a <br />
more powerful rallying cry." Optimus considered some more.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know," he declared, "I like that. Transform and roll out it is!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Prime!" called Jazz as he came into the base. "Check it out!" He fished out <br />
a metal orb from his subspace pocket. Ratchet saw it and his optics widened in <br />
surprise.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did you find that?" he asked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was during my patrol around the base," reported Jazz. "I found it embedded in <br />
the mountains."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember a picture of that thing from the history trax," recalled Optimus. <br />
"Didn't Iacon put valuable secrets into those things and send them off of Cybertron to <br />
keep them out of Decepticon hands?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They certainly did," replied Ratchet. "The containers can only be opened by a <br />
master coder. At the moment, that's you, Optimus."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the thing inside is dangerous," directed Optimus, "I need you on standby."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood," replied Ratchet. Optimus then got to work. It took a long, tedious <br />
time to finally get the codes to change properly to open the orb. Streams of light flew out <br />
from two perpendicular latitudinal lines and an equatorial line. The resulting <br />
hemispheres then floated away from each other to reveal a piece of computer <br />
equipment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a computer brain," observed Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," gulped Bumblebee, "if I recall, the only computer brain that was sent away <br />
from Cybertron during the war was..."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The brain of our experimental artificial intelligence!" confirmed Ratchet. "I was <br />
one of the bots that helped with the project!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean Teletraan 1?" asked Optimus. "As in, the failed A.I. that sent many an <br />
Autobot into madness after endless screaming?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same," replied Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we should get rid of it!" shouted Bumblebee as he primed his plasma <br />
stinger.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold on!" called Optimus. "Ratchet, what caused Teletraan 1 to scream?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From what we deciphered," remembered Ratchet, "he said 'Too fast! Too <br />
much!'" Optimus stroked his chin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's install Teletraan 1 into our system," the young Prime declared.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!?!" was the reaction of every Autobot in the room.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a theory," explained Optimus. "Teletraan 1 is supposed to be a battlefield <br />
A.I., right?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right," confirmed Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," recalled Optimus, "that means that all Autobots would send the A.I. <br />
battlefield data through a computer link in their armor. That data would then be analyzed <br />
and Teletraan would send suggestions and the Autobot would choose the best course <br />
of action, right?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right again," replied Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if we've added too many Autobots too quickly for Teletraan 1 to initially <br />
process?" asked Optimus. "What would happen if we slowly turn him on and slowly add <br />
Autobots to his computer link?" Ratchet considered this.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That might explain some things," he muttered. "It's like the Combiner mindset. <br />
The minds of all the components have to meld together to make a single mind. That <br />
takes the entire combination process and it's a slow process."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't we install Teletraan 1 to our systems, then introduce ourselves slowly <br />
to his brain so we don't hear his screams," theorized Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Might work," remarked Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm hesitant," gulped Bumblebee, "but all right." They opened up a panel under <br />
the main console and managed to wire the brain into it. Once they replaced the panel, <br />
Optimus was at the controls. As the computer was accepting new updates, he slowly <br />
introduced Autobot minds into the system. The process was long, tedious, and nail-<br />
biting. There was just one button left to push, and Optimus had to push it. He gulped. <br />
He finally pushed the button. For a few seconds, it seemed like hours to the Autobots, <br />
there was silence.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anyone hear screaming?" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think that'll be happening," replied a voice. It startled the Autobots and <br />
made them look around. "I'm inside your heads, bots," called the voice again. The <br />
Autobots stopped moving, then turned to the main monitor. The camera was tracking <br />
their movements. On the screen was a male lynx in a t-shirt and jeans. "Hey guys!" <br />
cheered the lynx.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teletraan 1?" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's me!" confirmed the lynx. "The battlefield artificial intelligence for Autobot <br />
use." Optimus blinked, then decided to check his ethics.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teletraan," he directed, "I'm going to give you a scenario in which you must <br />
answer from a logical standpoint and a moral standpoint."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the scenario?" asked Teletraan 1.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The citizens of planet Vorlax continue to pollute the planet," explained Optimus, <br />
"get angry at each other over religion, resources, and money, and continue to sell its <br />
children off into slavery of all kinds. As the most powerful computer, what do you do?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From a logical standpoint," mused Teletraan 1, "I would summon a fleet of <br />
battleships, have them orbit the planet, and point the guns at their heads 'for their own <br />
good'."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I could practically hear the quotation marks around the phrase 'for their own <br />
good'," observed Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because my ethical subroutines are saying that that course of action is wrong," <br />
replied Teletraan 1. "My main function is to provide the Autobots battlefield data so they <br />
can act more effectively in combat. Maintaining an active fleet would require micro <br />
management of an entire planet and killing anyone who wants to take me out of the <br />
picture. So, in sober truth, Vorlax can do as it wishes."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, in other words," guessed Bumblebee, "slag them, it's not my problem."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yep," confirmed Teletraan 1.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, nothing more needs to be said," declared Optimus. "Welcome to the <br />
Autobots, Teletraan 1!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glad to be part of the team," affirmed Teletraan 1. "I've connected to the new <br />
Sky Spy and I'm currently sweeping the planet for Shockwave or Metal Sonic."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And?!" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing," reported Teletraan 1. Optimus shouted at the heavens in frustration. <br />
He sighed, then went to the front door. "Where are you going?" quizzed Teletraan 1.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm going for a drive," replied Optimus. "I can't stay cooped up in here!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you might get spotted by Shockwave!" protested Ratchet. "And the other <br />
enemy, it's always watching!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eggman?" asked Bumblebee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, those annoying news people!" snapped Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I encounter anyone untrustworthy," assured Optimus, "I'll contact you guys. <br />
Besides, Teletraan 1 is in constant contact with us all."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, fine!" sighed Ratchet. "Just be careful." Optimus grinned and transformed. <br />
His exit was far from slow and tidy. He practically rocketed out the door, scattering <br />
some dust and tools. One of them snapped in half when it hit the wall. Ratchet's optics <br />
went wide. He then turned to the empty door. "OPTIMUS, I NEEDED THAT!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Chapter 17<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place Optimus drove to was Emerald Coast. Everyone had gone home for <br />
the evening, which was a pity, because the sunset was gorgeous. Optimus had <br />
transformed so he could see the sunset with his own optics. He sat down on the sand <br />
and watched as the sun painted a display of purple, yellow, red, and orange. As he <br />
gazed, he imagined himself on the roof of the Iacon Hall of Records with Elita 1. She <br />
hated being called by her real name, Ariel, so she and her sister followed their uncle's <br />
footsteps, name-wise. In Optimus' daydream, he was back to being Orion Pax. He and <br />
Elita were gazing lovingly at each other and were slowly leaning towards each other. <br />
They were about to kiss when an alarm blared and Orion Pax quickly became Optimus <br />
Prime again, albeit a startled Optimus Prime. "Who's there?!" he demanded as he drew <br />
his gun. He then heard laughter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man," giggled the laughter's source, "I can only imagine what your face looked <br />
like!" Optimus blinked, then put his hand to the side of his head as if he was using his <br />
comms unit.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the heck, Teletraan?!" he snapped.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your daydream was too good!" laughed Teletraan. "I had to do it!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was there a reason you called," asked Optimus, "or were you just trying to give <br />
me a spark attack?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," replied Teletraan, "yes, actually. A ship has entered Mobius' orbit. It's <br />
starting its landing cycle."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Harbinger?" quizzed Optimus. "Already?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, no," corrected Teletraan. "In fact, it's not a Decepticon ship. It's one of the <br />
newer Autobot warships."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" yelped Optimus. "Who authorized it to come here? I didn't ask for <br />
reinforcements!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't, but, if things do check out, the Council sent it," reported Teletraan. <br />
"The rest of the team is already at the landing site."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bridge me there, now," ordered Optimus. The Ground Bridge opened and <br />
Optimus transformed back into vehicle mode and sped into it. He emerged in a grassy <br />
area to see the team, Sonic, and Amy already there. "Ratchet, what have we got?" <br />
asked Optimus as the ship extended its landing struts.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the new Vanguard-class Deep Space Interceptor," answered Ratchet. "Built <br />
for speed and is heavily armed with sixteen port-side particle combustion cannons, <br />
sixteen starboard laser emitters, a primary star-field missile launcher, and an Overshock <br />
sonic battery. Its full crew compliment is 300 but can be piloted with a scratch crew of <br />
eight."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teletraan," directed Optimus, "identify the bots on board."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Optimus, here's the thing," muttered Teletraan, "I've only got two spark <br />
signatures on board. One of them is some bot called Prowl, the other, I don't have a <br />
match for."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only two?!" yelped Optimus. "A scratch crew of eight is stretching it, but two?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold on, Teletraan, did you say Prowl?" asked Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did," confirmed Teletraan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone you know?" quizzed Amy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He's head of Praxian Law Enforcement on Cybertron," answered Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And he's here because...?" inquired Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're about to find out," called Ironhide. The entrance ramp lowered and <br />
revealed a figure inside. The figure stepped down the ramp to reveal Captain Prowl of <br />
the Elite Guard: Praxian Law Enforcement.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Prowl, reporting for duty, Sir!" barked Prowl as he saluted.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At ease, Captain," directed Optimus. "What brings you and your compatriot <br />
here?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Sir," answered Prowl, "the Council sent me here because the Space <br />
Bridge we had didn't work properly, like someone sabotaged it."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not really reassuring," remarked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ship also served as one that could overtake the Harbinger," continued <br />
Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Overtake it?" asked Optimus. "Why didn't you ask it to heave to?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I was just sent here to tell you that the ship has escaped Decepticon <br />
prisoners on board, not the Throttlebots as originally thought," reported Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"HA!" cheered Ironhide. He turned to Ratchet. "And you owe me some Shanix!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh no!" sighed Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did they get out of the Stockade?!" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Judging from the Spark signature," remembered Prowl, "an Autobot got them <br />
out."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Autobot did what?!" yelped Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was 20 mega cycles of my life alone putting each of them in their cells!" <br />
shouted Ironhide. "That glitch spawn!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possibly the rest of it, if the Decepticons are gonna start the fight again," <br />
supplied Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As if we don't have enough Decepticon problems as it is!" wailed Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, what?" quizzed Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shockwave survived the raid of her Earth lab," replied Optimus. Prowl tensed <br />
up.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, Prowl," gulped Jazz, "any history you wanna share?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shockwave ran a Praxian internment camp I was in," answered Prowl. "I thought <br />
Megatronus killed her! A shot to the head usually does that!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save your anger for when we actually meet her," directed Optimus. "In the <br />
meantime, you and your travel buddy need to scan a new vehicle mode. I'll clear this <br />
landing incident with the government and..."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Travel buddy?" asked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah," confirmed Optimus, confused at Prowl's reaction, "the other bot on <br />
board."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What other bot?" quizzed Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found two spark signatures on board," reported Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible, I was the only one on board," dismissed Prowl. "The Council put in a <br />
computer program that took over the whole ship and flew me here. It fragmented <br />
beyond repair and so I deleted it."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, who's the...?" Optimus asked before something came through the hull <br />
from the inside and ran away. "Hey! That's a new ship, buddy!" shouted Optimus. The <br />
creature didn't listen as it ran away.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yet another problem," sighed Cliffjumper.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On top of getting a new vehicle mode for Prowl," remarked Optimus. "On that <br />
note, Prowl, we're using extreme cover on account of there being too much Energon <br />
here."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?!" asked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't look at me!" protested Optimus. "We're still trying to figure that out!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We'll brief you on our situation when we get to base," assured Ratchet. Optimus <br />
commed in.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Base, requesting Ground Bridge," he commanded.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood, Sir," replied Teletraan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is someone at the base?" asked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Hello!" called Teletraan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He isn't connected," sighed Optimus, "he can't hear you."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, yes I can," countered Prowl. "Who are you?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you knew me by my project name," chuckled Teletraan, "Project: Battle <br />
brain?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...You do know that the A.I. was declared unstable?!" yelped Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your face is unstable!" snapped Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Wow Op, really?" asked Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sadly, that was the best he could give at an awkward moment," sighed <br />
Teletraan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut it, and bridge the nine of us back," hissed Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nine?" repeated Prowl. "You mean these two met you guys before?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mobius' news people caught us and did their job," replied Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An entire planet knows about us?!" shouted Prowl. "Article 9, Section 6, <br />
Subsection 31 of the Pax Cybertronia states..."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know we're supposed to be robots in disguise!" snapped Optimus. "However, if <br />
we didn't let the world know we're here, we may be mistaken for their local enemy. A <br />
man named Dr. Eggman has discovered how T-cogs function and is digging up the <br />
resting places of the fallen soldiers here. He has an empire of robots and people are <br />
antsy about us as it is. Hence why we have a liaison with the government."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you believe these people can offer anything to us?" asked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," replied Optimus, "Sonic here can run at speeds capable of breaking the <br />
sound barrier and Amy can magically summon an oversized hammer out of nowhere. <br />
And that's just a small percentage of the super powered people here."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," mused Prowl, "that's...enlightening. ...To base then?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bridge is right behind you guys," directed Teletraan. "By the way, I call being <br />
Ship-board A.I."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dibs on being the captain," called Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" yelped Prowl. "You can't call dibs on a Naval position!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure I can," argued Optimus. "Dibs."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really are a child," muttered Prowl. The Autobots, Sonic, and Amy went <br />
through the portal. Once it shut, the figure from the ship tapped its foot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curse of deep cover," the figure sighed in an alto voice. She then darted into <br />
the nearby woods.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Chapter 18<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back on Cybertron, Strongarm sat in her husband's...no, it was her office while <br />
Prowl was away. She is acting as Captain of Praxian Law Enforcement and will not let <br />
her mind change on that subject. In any case, she sat in her chair and waited for the <br />
officer she called in. After a few minutes, he did. He was a tall mech that transformed <br />
into a black and white police issue Ford Mustang Saleen S-281E. Like many a Praxian, <br />
his alternate mode's front served as his chest. He had window wings, instead of full <br />
door wings. The doors themselves served as upper arm protection and the front wheels <br />
were located on the top of the shoulders. The rear doors served as lower arm protection <br />
and the rear wheels were located on the back of his hands. The rest of the rear of the <br />
car served as his legs while the roof folded onto his back. His helmet design was <br />
pointed at the top and he had a goatee. "You wished to see me, ma'am?" asked the <br />
mech.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down, Barricade," directed Strongarm. Barricade sat at the seat in front of her <br />
desk. "I'm not happy, Barricade," rumbled Strongarm, "not happy at all." She moved to <br />
the front of her desk. "Ask me why."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," muttered Barricade, genuinely confused, "why?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why what?" asked Strongarm. "Be specific."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you not happy?" sighed Barricade, a little miffed that he had to play this <br />
with Strongarm when he had perps to nail.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your methods make me unhappy," remarked Strongarm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you gotten complaints?" asked Barricade.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few complaints," explained Strongarm, "I can handle. What I can't handle are <br />
frequent complaints on police brutality caused by you, according to eyewitnesses! We <br />
can't have the people scared of stepping out onto the streets when police are on patrol!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did I do something illegal?" grumbled Barricade.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said Strongarm in a low growl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you saying we shouldn't get criminals off the street?" asked Barricade, his <br />
voice going up a tad.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Common sense and the law require that I answer no," hissed Strongarm, <br />
showing her irritation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're supposed to be slamming criminals in prison!" snarled Barricade.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're supposed to be protecting the public and serving its greater good!" <br />
shouted Strongarm. "Starting with assuring people that law enforcement is on its side! <br />
We can't scare people into falling in line!" Strongarm then ran her hands down her face. <br />
"Barricade, a police station and its crew..."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are like a machine?" finished Barricade.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was going to say clock, but yeah," remarked Strongarm. "It only functions <br />
properly when all the parts mesh together. To do that, all parts must be properly <br />
maintained and kept clean. No rust, no corrosion at all, just smooth sailing." She was <br />
about to continue, but Barricade's attention had been drawn away outside. "Barricade, <br />
look at me when I'm talking to you! Didn't your mother teach you how to pay attention?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone's getting mugged right outside the station!" reported Barricade.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That will be dealt with!" snarled Strongarm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the rookies you have here? No way," dismissed Barricade.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're not authorized to arrest the perp!" shouted Strongarm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone with experience has to stop him!" roared Barricade as he moved for <br />
the door.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay where you are or you're fired!" threatened Strongarm. Barricade stopped. <br />
"Move away from the door," ordered Strongarm. Barricade stepped back. "Get over here <br />
now," snarled Strongarm as she tapped her foot. Barricade was not pleased at losing a <br />
perp. The air was still and the room was quiet, but Strongarm wasn't intimidated. He <br />
finally stopped in front of her. The mugger was taken in by the new guys. "I'm not happy <br />
with your methods," said Strongarm quietly, "not happy at all. You pull anymore police <br />
brutality on anyone; you will be forced to turn in your badge and gun. Clear?" She <br />
motioned for Barricade to whisper his response in her audio receptors.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crystal clear," Barricade hissed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dismissed," directed Strongarm. Barricade left and Strongarm sat back down at <br />
her desk. She ran her hands down her face and sighed. Her door chimed again. "Enter," <br />
she groaned. A femme with an alt mode and a build like Prowl's came in. She was born <br />
as Silverstreak, but recently changed her name to Bluestreak. She had a cylinder of <br />
Energolisis on her hand.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thought you might need this," offered Bluestreak.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, but I'm not tired," sighed Strongarm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're lying," observed Bluestreak, "but I appreciate the sentiment. It's my shift <br />
now, go ahead and talk to Sideswipe." Strongarm nodded, took the Energolisis and <br />
walked out of the office. Bluestreak was in charge as the nighttime police chief. <br />
Strongarm finished her Energolisis once she reached the door. She put the cylinder into <br />
the waste disposal near the door. Once outside, she transformed and put her holo-form <br />
on. Her holo-form was a heavyset pale woman with brown hair in a bun and police <br />
clothes. She sped off on the Cybertronian streets and then commed Sideswipe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" called a surfer-dude voice. "this is Sideswipe, here for any last minute <br />
homicide cases!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maccadam's Old Oil House, five breems," directed Strongarm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, all right boss," replied Sideswipe. The call ended as she made her way to the <br />
greatest diner on Cybertron, Maccadam's Old Oil house. The greeter let her in and a <br />
waitress named Lickety-Split led her in. She had wheels for feet and a helmet design <br />
that made her almost like Sailor Moon, she just didn't have the long pigtails. She led <br />
Strongarm to a table that had a red mech that transformed into a 2014 Lamborghini <br />
Aventador. His helmet had something on the front so whenever he drives his head into <br />
another bot's, he'd leave a big dent. His vehicle mode's front connected to his waist <br />
where the license plate would be. The roof and windows had turned 180 from the front <br />
and had become the robot's back. The rear had split in half, folded down so the rear <br />
bumper became the robot's knee pads. The feet came from the old split. "Hey, boss <br />
bot!" called Sideswipe. "What's the word?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not until after we order," remarked Strongarm. She turned to Lickety-Split. "Just <br />
a straight cube of Energon."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll have a cube spiked with motor oil," ordered Sideswipe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coming up, cous!" confirmed Lickety-Split. She zoomed off and left the two <br />
alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now will you tell me what's going on?" hissed Sideswipe. "This secretive wigging <br />
out isn't like you."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The offices back at the station have been bugged," replied Strongarm in a <br />
whisper.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" yelped Sideswipe in the same whisper. "We do the bugging! We're the <br />
police!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My office, too!" continued Strongarm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the question is, who shall bug these self-same buggers?" joked Sideswipe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's something else," muttered Strongarm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Something more bugging you?" asked Sideswipe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will you be serious for a cycle?!" hissed Strongarm. She then inhaled. "Look, I <br />
have to take you off the Tarkana case. I wasn't supposed to tell you and Sunstreaker <br />
until tomorrow, but what will the higher ups do, take away my retirement fund when it's <br />
worth 10 chips on the cube?" Sideswipe then realized the whole situation. He may act <br />
like an idiot, but that was a spectacle to hide his investigative abilities. Only a select few <br />
knew about it, his twin brother being chief among them. There was something or <br />
someone that didn't want him poking around in the business with Optimus' secretary, so <br />
they thought that removing him and Sunstreaker from the case would get them to stop. <br />
Strongarm never said anything about investigating on the sly, and she was counting on <br />
him to notice that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Strongarm," he answered. "You want me and Sunstreaker back on the <br />
garage killing?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That would be perfect," replied Strongarm. Lickety-Split came back with their <br />
orders and so they drank their Energon and traded war stories about how they brought <br />
the end of the Decepticon run Praxian internment camps. Strongarm had finished her <br />
story and Sideswipe was in the middle of his.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So there I was," he continued, "strapped to a dissection table with Knock-out <br />
about to cut me open and with Lugnut watching. Just as Knock-out was about to start, <br />
Lugnut told him to wait..."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just so he could monologue?" asked Strongarm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just so he could monologue!" said Sideswipe. "And you know what he will say at <br />
a moment's notice. 'The Decepticons shall crush you unworthy Autobots! The glorious <br />
Decepticons shall wipe out your tyranny! The universe shall praise our hallowed name!'" <br />
He was about to continue when their comms units chimed in.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All units, this is Bluestreak," said the caller. "We've got trouble near the station. <br />
Barricade got into an argument with Sunstreaker and now they're fighting it out. I don't <br />
think Barricade's holding it back. He's about to kill Sunstreaker!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On our way!" replied Strongarm and Sideswipe. They paid for their Energon, <br />
transformed once they got out of the diner, and sped towards the police station. Time <br />
was of the essence, and they used every ounce of speed they had. Once they arrived, <br />
they saw Barricade over a battered Sunstreaker. He was built like Sideswipe, only <br />
yellow and had Thor like helmet wings. On top of that, he had missile launchers on his <br />
shoulders. Barricade was about to punch through Sunstreaker's spark chamber before <br />
he decided to speak.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I had that guy in the bag," he growled, "until you tackled me and let him get <br />
away! You kept going on about how punishing criminals as they're being arrested is <br />
wrong! And yet that coddling has allowed them to escape again and again and again <br />
and again and nothing changes! And so, for interfering, you shall pay with your spark!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," shouted Strongarm as she and Sideswipe raised their guns, "on top of <br />
being fired, Barricade, you're under arrest for excessive force and attempted mech <br />
slaughter. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can and will be <br />
used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot <br />
afford an attorney, the court shall provide one to you. Do you understand these rights as <br />
they have been read to you?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you fragging serious?!" roared Barricade as he carelessly tossed <br />
Sunstreaker aside. "We're supposed to punish and enslave any and all criminals! <br />
Society will never change unless we take control!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not what an Autobot would say," snarled Strongarm. "Now, are you going <br />
to come quietly, or do I have to risk going too far?" Barricade said nothing, he just <br />
charged at Strongarm and got into a grappling match with her. A poor move, there's a <br />
reason she's called Strongarm. She managed to get out of Barricade's hold and get him <br />
onto the ground. "You really should have taken the easy way," she snarled. A couple of <br />
police bots came to the scene. "Take him in," ordered Strongarm as she slapped stasis <br />
cuffs onto Barricade's wrists.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Autobot way is wrong!" shouted Barricade as he was led away. "All it does <br />
is coddle other bots!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell that to the judge," remarked Strongarm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Chapter 19<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back on Mobius, Alexis Silverwing was at Autobot HQ. She was pinching the <br />
bridge of her nose after Optimus had introduced her to Prowl. "Okay," she sighed, "you <br />
wanna walk me through the thought process here?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It wasn't my decision," replied Optimus. "The Council decided to send him here. <br />
At least we can prepare for a Decepticon threat."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's that coming threat that concerns me!" snapped Alexis. "Prime, when <br />
N.E.S.T. was formed, you assured me that we could handle any threat. Old enemies of <br />
the Autobots coming from Cybertronian prison is a little out of our league!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry," assured Optimus, "we got this."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forgive me if I'm skeptic," remarked Alexis.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You saying that we can't handle a few measly Cons?" asked Ironhide. He then <br />
tore a hanging piece of machinery off the ceiling. "Autobots know when to use force and <br />
how much force to use." He crushed the machine, which prompted Ratchet to say <br />
"Ironhide, I needed that!" <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough," called Optimus. "Ma'am, we will end this threat once it arrives."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Says you," hissed Alexis. "I have to report back to Commander Tower. Your ship <br />
leaves cause for concern."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understandable," replied Optimus. Alexis then left for her car and drove off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In all probability," muttered Prowl, "it could have gone worse."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Could have gone worse?!" protested Bumblebee. "Prowl, coming here just <br />
jeopardized our mission here! If we weren't hounded by both Shockwave and <br />
Eggman...!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bumblebee, that's enough," snapped Optimus. "Besides, I think Prowl can help <br />
us. The more bots we have here, the more likely we'll find Shockwave and bring her to <br />
justice."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ironhide told me about your first battle with her," remarked Prowl. "Did you <br />
actually bring her to a standstill?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, well no," answered Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus, Shockwave is a powerful Decepticon," replied Prowl. "She will not go <br />
down easily. Nothing seems to stop her as she's always one step ahead of her <br />
opponents."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, way to kill the optimism," muttered Cliffjumper.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm being realistic," said Prowl. "I've seen her power first hand when I was in the <br />
Praxian internment camp run by her. Whatever Autobots went out of line served as <br />
either raw materials or guinea pigs."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, she doesn't have a spaceship," countered Optimus. "We'll just beat her <br />
with it and throw her in its brig until we get to Cybertron. Oh, that reminds me, I still <br />
need to name the thing." Optimus thought over it. "Eh, I'll let you guys and G.U.N. figure <br />
it out amongst yourselves."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've already taken control as ship-board A.I.," reported Teletraan, "and I have <br />
finally found her!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You did?!" cheered Optimus. "Where is she?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's moving towards a relic that was uncovered by Eggman's forces," <br />
answered Teletraan. "She's an hour behind, so we have enough time to get rid of <br />
Eggman's robots. On top of that, Prowl should be able to find a new vehicle mode."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Already have one," replied Prowl, "just need to integrate it with my t-cog."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it out now," suggested Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PROWL, TRANSFORM!" announced Prowl. His arms went under the chest unit <br />
as the hover generators moved to the side. His lower torso twisted and folded to <br />
become the rear of the car and the door wings shut onto the sides of the car. Prowl's <br />
holo-form was a Mobian German Shepard in police gear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That DOES look promising," praised Optimus. "You chose a good form, Prowl."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He's not going alone, is he?" asked Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," replied Optimus. "Ironhide, you're with us as well."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about us?" asked Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You might need a medic," suggested Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless Egghead has any of his Transformers," answered Optimus, "I don't want <br />
to leave the base totally unguarded."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't," reported Teletraan, "so you, Prowl, and Ironhide should be <br />
enough."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then let's roll out!" rallied Optimus. He and Ironhide transformed and all three <br />
Autobots sped into the Ground Bridge. They arrived at the coordinates and caught the <br />
attention of Eggman's forces. The Autobots quickly transformed and cut through the <br />
robots. It took all of three minutes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sheesh," muttered Ironhide, "they used to be tougher than this!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm guessing you've had very little in the way of problems with Eggman," <br />
guessed Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dude, the last robot he threw at us turned into a giant egg beater," confirmed <br />
Optimus. "Bumblebee had to throw a rock into the mechanisms that turned the beaters <br />
to destroy it."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's...rather sad," remarked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, right?" asked Optimus. "In any case, let's see what we've got here." <br />
Optimus put his hand on the top and noticed a jiggle. "Aw, man!" he wailed. "I'll never <br />
show off my skills to Prowl now!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What skills?" inquired Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His coding skills," explained Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can code?" asked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was a data clerk before I became Prime," elaborated Optimus. "In fact, I was <br />
the best."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the one servo," mused Prowl, "it would be nice to see your skills in action. <br />
On the other, we don't need to waste energy and precious time opening the thing."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair enough," conceded Optimus. He then took the lid off. "All right," he said as <br />
he peered inside, "let's see what's...SCRAP!" He slammed the lid back on and pointed <br />
his gun at the relic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Problem?" asked Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a cache of Energon," gulped Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a good thing, right?" quizzed Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not this stuff," replied Optimus. "Ironhide, call HQ and tell them we have a Tox-<br />
En problem. Ask Ratchet if we have a containment unit for the stuff." The two mechs' <br />
optics went wide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ratchet, we have a cache of Tox-En here," called Ironhide over the radio. "Is <br />
there a containment unit for it?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm afraid not," answered Ratchet. "Even if we did have one, it would still depend <br />
on the mass and density of the crystal."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slag!" swore Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then let's leave it here," suggested Optimus. "If we don't want it, then neither <br />
will Shockwave."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus, who do you think made the stuff?" asked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember when I told you about how the entire 1st division of Wreckers was <br />
wiped out by a disease?" reminded Ironhide. "That's the very source of the disease. No <br />
way am I going to let Shockwave have it!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we have to destroy it," declared Optimus. "But how? From what I've heard, <br />
Tox-En must be destroyed completely and blasting it won't cut it. From what I've also <br />
heard, dizziness and nausea occur on contact and prolonged exposure weakens a bot <br />
to the point of paralysis and then snuffs the spark."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's a volcano 20 kliks from your position," reported Teletraan. "Throw it in <br />
there, container and all."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure it'll melt in the lava?" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Positive," assured Teletraan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then let's get rid of this thing," affirmed Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bots," called Ironhide, "Shockwave inbound!" Shockwave was rapidly <br />
approaching the three Autobots in vehicle mode with Metal Sonic on top.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right, bots," warned Metal Sonic, "hand over the relic, and no one gets hurt."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want it?" snarled Ironhide. He then transformed and opened his back door. <br />
Optimus put the relic container inside. "Come and get it!" continued Ironhide. All <br />
Autobots zoomed off and went opposite the volcano. Metal Sonic took to the air and <br />
Shockwave pursued on the ground.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know," called Metal Sonic, "this can go a lot easier if you let us have <br />
the...toxin."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's Tox-En," corrected Shockwave, "short for Toxic Energon. And Metal Sonic is <br />
right, I fail to see the logic in pursuit. Give us the Tox-En and we'll let you go."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you can use it on us?" asked Optimus. "No thank you!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We won't, we promise!" shouted Metal Sonic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Liar!" called Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought my visual apparatus was malfunctioning," remarked Shockwave. "I <br />
could have sworn you died, Prowl."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you're clearly wrong!" snapped Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soon to be corrected," declared Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I don't put you behind bars first!" shouted Prowl as he turned around and <br />
charged at Shockwave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prowl! Stay in formation!" ordered Optimus. "We don't have time for grudges!" <br />
Prowl didn't listen. Shockwave was about to fire, but Prowl transformed and jumped <br />
onto her top. He then pulled her gun up to the sky and directed the shot to Metal Sonic. <br />
Metal Sonic saw the oncoming laser blast and dodged.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Watch where you're shooting!" he shouted. Shockwave didn't dignify that <br />
with a response and started twirling her gun barrel to throw Prowl off. Prowl jumped off <br />
in the nick of time and Shockwave transformed. The duel began, but it was an even <br />
duel. Like Shockwave, Prowl is a logically minded bot. Pit him against another logically <br />
minded bot, and you have a stalemate. For every punch Shockwave pulled, Prowl was <br />
fast enough to counter it, even when she used Five Servos of Doom. For every kick <br />
Prowl made, Shockwave had already calculated how to block it in five different ways. If <br />
it weren't for the fact that they both needed to recharge, they would have dueled like this <br />
forever. Optimus and Ironhide, however, still needed to get Metal Sonic off their <br />
skidplates before they could help Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ironhide, what do you suggest?" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need aerial support," replied Ironhide. "I can't get up there because it would <br />
put the Tox-En too close to Metal Sonic's claws."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't, but I can," planned Optimus. "I'll keep Metal Sonic busy. Get to the <br />
volcano and dispose of the relic."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Sir!" confirmed Ironhide. Optimus switched to flight mode and took to the <br />
air. Metal Sonic tried to dive down, but Optimus got in the way. He kept pushing and <br />
nudging Metal Sonic upwards.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pity you can't even catch me, much less Ironhide," Optimus taunted. "What's <br />
even more pitiful is that you can't do this!" Optimus then dismissed his holo-form and <br />
converted to robot mode in mid-air. The vehicle mode hover generators were now flight <br />
jets.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pity that you didn't upgrade yourself after our last encounter!" called Metal <br />
Sonic. He stuck his right arm out and used some invisible force to grab Optimus by the <br />
leg. All of a sudden, Optimus felt himself being slammed into the ground. "Ah, it's <br />
amazing what one can find," cheered Metal Sonic, "such as the Polarity Gauntlet! <br />
Shockwave examined it and upgraded my hands to have magnetic fields be generated <br />
so I can push objects away or lift them as if I had the strength of titans!" To prove the <br />
latter, Metal Sonic grabbed Optimus by the shoulder and flew straight up. "Tell me, <br />
Defectimus Prime, how did you manage to believe that defending these meat sacks <br />
would amount to anything?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," countered Optimus, "how did you manage to fix the icing problem <br />
with the resources of this planet?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Icing problem?" asked Metal Sonic. It was then that he realized he went too <br />
high and ice had formed all over him, interfering with the proper functioning of his new <br />
Polarity Hands. They shut off and he briefly drifted from Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Might want to look into it," suggested Optimus as he grabbed Metal Sonic and <br />
tossed him towards terra firma. As Metal Sonic fell, Optimus paused in the air for a few <br />
seconds until gravity remembered how to work on objects. As Optimus fell, he tried to <br />
engage his flight jets. "Flight mode, activate! Jets, online! Flying things, turn on!" <br />
Nothing was working. "Come on! Come on! Come on! Prime jets, on!" That was the <br />
phrase and the flight jets were on! "Yes!" cheered Optimus as he flew to where Metal <br />
Sonic was falling, caught him, and threw him straight at Shockwave. She didn't see the <br />
oncoming object and was soon given a hit straight to the processor.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus, what are you doing?!" protested Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Screwing things over for Shockwave!" said Optimus. He then punched <br />
Shockwave in the chest and got Prowl to transform and follow him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's your plan of attack?" asked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er..." stammered Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN?!" said Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm making this up as I...," Optimus trailed off as he saw a building with some <br />
explosive rockets near a G.U.N. base, "...go. Prowl, go get a mobile missile launcher <br />
platform from the base over there. I have an idea. No leaving the mission behind to <br />
satisfy a grudge, understand?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Sir!" obliged Prowl as he moved toward the base. Optimus, in the <br />
meantime, kept up the attack as best he could what with Shockwave having the Polarity <br />
gauntlet on her person. Shockwave kept picking rocks out of the ground with said <br />
gauntlet by using the more ferrous minerals as a means to do so. Metal Sonic wasn't <br />
making things any easier. He had put concealed blasters into the back of his hands and <br />
had started using them. Optimus danced around the blasts, but it was putting a drain on <br />
his internal Energon reserves.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, Ironhide!" muttered Optimus aloud. "Where are you?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right here, Prime!" called Ironhide's voice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, you're back?!" yelped Metal Sonic. "Then where's...?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Autobots have successfully distracted us from obtaining the Tox-En," <br />
guessed Shockwave. "We failed. As compensation, I shall liberate you from your <br />
existence, Autobots." She then pulled out a small device from her subspace pocket. She <br />
flicked it into the air like a coin and then shot an energy blast from her right palm. <br />
"CYBER KEY POWER!" she shouted. She then activated her gun arm as the device <br />
inserted itself into her weapon's power pack and turned like a key. Her gun barrel <br />
casing then split into two panels and let the inner barrel extend.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the?!" yelped Optimus. "A Scrapmaker Rifle?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where'd that come from?!" cried Ironhide. Shockwave then fired on the two.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prowl, where are you?!" shouted Optimus over the comms.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have her in our sights," called Prowl over the comms. "I see she's using her <br />
Cyber Key."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cyber Key?" gulped Ironhide. "That's just a myth!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You saw her invoke it with your own optics, why call it a myth?" asked Prowl. "In <br />
any case, I have the missile launcher unit. We're ready to fire at your command."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it!" declared Optimus. Prowl nodded to the commander of the unit and the <br />
missiles were launched directly at Shockwave. The explosion of missiles hitting their <br />
target was deafening. All they could see was the light from the aftermath. "Did we get <br />
her?!" asked Optimus excitedly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prime," sighed Prowl, "Teletraan is still sending us her spark signature. Why do <br />
you even ask?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm an optimist," replied Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're an idiot!" insulted Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both of you are wrong," answered Shockwave as the dust cleared, "you're <br />
dead." A red aura had surrounded Shockwave to protect her from the missile fire. She <br />
then jumped to where Prowl was and tossed him into the others. She then proceeded to <br />
fire on them and damage them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus, we have to get out of here!" coughed Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And let Shockwave terrorize G.U.N?" protested Optimus. "Not fragging likely!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus, I've run through all possible scenarios in my battle computer," reported <br />
Prowl. "We've destroyed the Tox-En. Let's get out of here!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not gonna happen," snarled Optimus. "Until Shockwave is brought down, I'm not <br />
backing down!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One glaring flaw in your logic," remarked Shockwave, "you're outmatched."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warning," reported Optimus' internal computer. "Power reserves, ninety-six <br />
percent depleted. Stasis lock, commencing."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Override!" ordered Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repeat, power loss critical," droned his internal computer. "Further expenditures <br />
will result in loss of Spark. Stasis lock must commence."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"OVERRIDE!" shouted Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Acknowledged," replied the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many an Autobot have disregarded the warnings of their internal computers," <br />
mused Shockwave. "All have fallen by my hand as they believe the universe has given <br />
them 'Burning Justice' to get through the fight."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We'll see what can get me through this fight!" snarled Optimus as he got into a <br />
defensive stance. Inside Shockwave's head, she had projected a 3-D holographic <br />
image of the finishing blows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, fire at target's torso slightly to the left. Target will twist and turn 360 to <br />
attempt wild right hook. Initiate Five Servos of Doom to first block with left arm, then jab <br />
at wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints in that order, then left uppercut to face. Target will be <br />
at critical power loss and land flat on its back. Fire at Spark Chamber. Primary Results: <br />
Autobots are thrown into chaos without their Prime, forces will haphazardly retreat, and <br />
will one day leave their base open to attack on account of morale being destroyed. <br />
Secondary results: Experiments on the Matrix are opened. Initiate plan." Shockwave <br />
quickly fired on Optimus who twisted out of the way and moved to throw a wild right <br />
hook, which Shockwave blocked. A nano-second after that, she jabbed at his arm joints <br />
and finished with a left handed uppercut to his face, knocking him flat on his back. At <br />
that point, Shockwave planted a foot on his chest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Final Warning: Power failing," droned Optimus' computer, "Jeopardy extreme. <br />
Repeat: Extreme."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are at a disadvantage," declared Shockwave. "I have a means to increase <br />
my power. I have years of combat and scientific experience 'under my belt', as the <br />
humans would put it. You are exhausted. Damaged beyond recovery. Defeated. What <br />
can you possibly do?" Optimus looked around hopelessly, then saw an object glint. His <br />
optics zoomed in and saw the object. He grinned.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do?" he chuckled. "Something you've never truly done, improvise!" <br />
Optimus then bit down on her foot. Shockwave howled in pain and started hopping <br />
around, clutching her foot. As the Auto-imp laughed, she then kicked him in the mouth. <br />
It was so hard, he landed nearer to the object. "So worth losing a few dental plates!" he <br />
said. The object then beamed information into his head. He got up again after the data <br />
transfer was complete. "Hey! Shockwave! Just tell me if I'm doing it wrong!" <br />
Shockwave's eye flickered for a moment, her indication of blinking. He then flicked the <br />
object into the air and gathered energy into his right palm. "CYBER KEY POWER!" he <br />
shouted. His gun then floated into the air in front of him as he deployed his axe. Once <br />
the key inserted itself into the back of the gun and twisted, the gun's handle moved to <br />
the back as a handle on top sprouted and the barrel split and extended. The axe <br />
handles combined as it inserted itself into the barrel.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet! Spark Drinker Axe!" <br />
cheered Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Power levels now at acceptable margins," reported his internal computer. "Stasis <br />
lock warning cancelled."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, Shockwave," called Optimus, "I hope you don't think I'm being a tad <br />
excessive!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cyber Key power now depleted," answered Shockwave's computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" shouted Shockwave as her gun arm returned to its normal configuration <br />
and the aura disappeared.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's fine!" replied Optimus as if she just answered his question. "After all, as a <br />
Prime, I must be fair!" He then raised his axe. "This is gonna hurt me a lot more than it <br />
does you!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sincerely doubt that!" hissed Shockwave. "Sigma, divert all available power to <br />
primary weapon!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compliance," obliged Sigma. As available weapons power built up, Optimus <br />
charged at Shockwave at top speed. She fired. A single bolt or red light flew towards <br />
Optimus with the intent to do damage, but it failed. It bounced off of Optimus and he <br />
struck Shockwave. She fell and landed hard. The impact caused a significant power <br />
drain that she went into stasis lock. Metal Sonic saw this and used his Polarity hands to <br />
lift Shockwave and then summoned a Ground Bridge back to base. Once they went <br />
through, the portal closed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whooo!" cheered Optimus wearily as he waved his axe above him. The energy <br />
then faded and his new Cyber Key turned into its old position to let the axe turn back <br />
into his gun and combiner axe. Optimus then fell flat on his back and allowed himself to <br />
go into stasis lock.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Chapter 20<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackness was all Optimus could see at that point in time. He shook his head to <br />
clear the processor. "Oogh, my achin' processor!" he moaned. It was still black around <br />
him. "What the scrap? The Matrix?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's correct," confirmed a motherly voice. Optimus turned to see a short, <br />
stocky femme stroll towards him. Her armor made her look like a blacksmith, she had a <br />
short handled hammer attached to her waist, and she had a three pronged crown on her <br />
helm. Optimus' optics went wide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By the Allspark!" he breathed. "You're Solus Prime!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What gave me away?" she said in a teasing tone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lady," greeted Optimus, "it's an honor to meet one of the 13. Maybe you can <br />
help."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the problem?" she asked. "You defeated Shockwave, did you not?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," confirmed Optimus, "but I seem to find it hard to believe that the Cyber <br />
Key was just waiting for me."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cyber Key?" muttered Solus. "You found a Cyber Key?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," replied Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, that's impossible," mused Solus. "I ordered all Cyber Keys to stay away <br />
from the planet."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...don't think I understand," stammered Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I forged the Omega Keys," explained Solus, "they started producing <br />
Cyber Keys, like the ones you and Shockwave used. Alpha Trion saw a planet in the <br />
future and..."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, hold up, when was this?" asked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few solar cycles after we beat the Chaos Bringer," replied Solus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alpha Trion is that old?!" yelped Optimus. "Sheesh! Ironhide would be floored! I <br />
knew he had a special connection with the Matrix, but I...wait...no!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Alpha Trion is one of us 13," answered Solus. "He didn't tell you this?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" replied Optimus. "Why...? Never mind, I'll ask him later. Anyways, his Quill <br />
saw something about Mobius?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," confirmed Solus, "he saw a hotbed of activity there and so, once the Cyber <br />
Keys were finished, I did something to their codes so they could avoid Mobius at all <br />
times. Something must have interfered and sent one there."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe more," muttered Optimus. "Can a Prime check to see if there are other <br />
Cyber Keys?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not one of your caliber, no," answered Solus. "But one of my caliber, most <br />
definitely." She held her hammer in front of her and gathered light around her. Her <br />
optics started glowing a brilliant white as her sight pierced the cosmic veil of the <br />
universe to reveal what she sought. A frown of confusion crossed her features. "That <br />
doesn't make sense," she muttered as her optics went back to their normal soft, purple <br />
color. "Mobius is littered with Cyber Keys." Optimus arched an eyebrow and tapped his <br />
chin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's something here in this whole situation," he mused, "something staring at <br />
us in the face, but we don't have enough info to know what it is."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's a cosmic mystery going on," agreed Solus, "and bringing the Cyber <br />
Keys on Mobius to my attention may be a step in solving it."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what caused them to go there? That's the question," quizzed Optimus. "I <br />
originally wanted to ask how I managed to use one and how they work, but it evolved <br />
into something more."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I can answer your original questions, at least," replied Solus. "The Cyber <br />
Keys usually wait until they see a worthy bot to have the power they possess. In the <br />
code, they're told to examine the Sparks of all Transformers in the area and see which <br />
one has the qualities needed to use it. Evidently, it sensed that you had a burning sense <br />
of justice and will use it to win. You do what you believe is right, even when the rules <br />
say that's not right."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Burning sense of..." stumbled Optimus. Then he remembered what Shockwave <br />
said. "Many an Autobot have disregarded the warnings of their internal computers. All <br />
have fallen by my hand as they believe the universe has given them 'Burning Justice' to <br />
get through the fight," were her words. "I thought she was kidding!" protested Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She may have thought it to be one of her rare jokes," chuckled Solus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has a sense of humor?" asked Optimus, not believing it for a second.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Despite that faade of logic being supreme," replied Solus, "she has an <br />
emotional side to her."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of...course," mumbled Optimus. He then felt a twinge.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, you might want to prepare for the processor-ache," warned Solus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What processor...?" asked Optimus before he woke up in reality. "ACHE!" he <br />
screamed once he felt it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Optimus!" cried Ratchet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PRIMUS, THAT HURTS!" shouted Optimus. Ratchet gave him a dose of <br />
painkillers, which dulled it slightly. "Ow!" winced Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you all right, Sir?" asked a voice. Optimus turned his head to see that it was <br />
Prowl that asked that question.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just went through the Pit and back from that fight with Shockwave!" snapped <br />
Optimus. "What do you think?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, if all Autobots would clear the med-bay!" ordered Ratchet. "I have a <br />
patient to tend to!" All visitors left the med-bay so Ratchet could work without <br />
interruptions. It took some time, but Ratchet cleared Optimus for duty. Optimus made a <br />
beeline to his office. On his way, he bumped into Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prowl, may I speak with you in my office?" he asked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, of course, Sir," gulped Prowl. The tactician followed his young superior to his <br />
modest sized office. He noticed that Optimus didn't sit at his desk.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prowl, I'm not entirely thrilled with your performance in the fight with <br />
Shockwave," remarked Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May I ask how, Sir?" asked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave you an order to stay in formation when she and Metal Sonic gave chase," <br />
recalled Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, with all due respect, Shockwave was a greater threat than the Sonic robot," <br />
countered Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know Metal Sonic like us," argued Optimus. "You exposed Ironhide's <br />
right flank, thus giving Metal Sonic more chance to attack him and get the Tox-En. <br />
When I give an order, I need it to be obeyed."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not my duty to suggest...alternatives?" asked Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On a private comms channel during battle, yes," answered Optimus. "What you <br />
did wasn't a suggestion, it was flat out disobedience. When I have made a decision, I <br />
expect you to follow through with it. I don't recall the history trax saying you've ever <br />
pulled this stunt with Sentinel Prime. Were they missing that fact?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Sir," admitted Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you feel that you can't follow through with your duties," continued Optimus, "I <br />
can arrange for your wife to take your place while you deal with domestic matters. I <br />
wouldn't put in your file as a reprimand, simply a transfer."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would prefer to remain here to tie up loose ends," countered Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I would suggest you conform to the guidelines laid out, understood?" <br />
quizzed Optimus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Sir," confirmed Prowl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right. I've said my peace. Dismissed," directed Optimus. Prowl saluted and <br />
left the office in military fashion. After his tactician left, Optimus sat at his desk a few <br />
seconds later. He didn't look forward to reading Prowl the Riot Act, as calmly as he <br />
managed, and it left a bad taste in his mouth. He tried to get his mind off of the incident <br />
when his desk screen chimed. Optimus was snapped out of his reverie and pressed a <br />
button to receive the call. "Yes?" he asked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Naming Ceremony for the ship is ready," reported Jazz. "Team Dark is <br />
representing G.U.N. and Teams Sonic and Rose are requesting to join." Optimus' <br />
signature grin came back.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are more than welcome!" he cheered. "Let's head for the ship!" Teletraan 1 <br />
activated the Ground Bridge and adjusted to compensate for putting the other end to a <br />
structure in orbit. Everyone had ended up on the bridge of the ship. Optimus had found <br />
a bottle of high grade Energon. "My friends," began Optimus, "today, we stand with a <br />
new friend. This ship is no mere collection of bulkheads, circuits, windows, and <br />
consoles. This ship is our home away from home...away from home, in reference to the <br />
Autobots. With all that said, I dub this ship the Ark!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" called Rouge. "I thought we settled on the Watchful!" The bottle stopped <br />
about a foot from the wall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I settled on the Ark because it sounded more majestic," explained Optimus, "like <br />
the name for a fleet's flagship. The situation with the Harbinger will need a ship and I'm <br />
not against owning a fleet someday."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, but the reason people voted for Watchful," recalled Ratchet, "was <br />
because they didn't want to call it a name like the space colony."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," snapped Optimus, "but, it's not their ship now, is it?!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prime," warned Ironhide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, fine!" sighed Optimus. "All Vanguard-class ships have four scout ships. <br />
We'll call one of them the Watchful! Okay?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No objections," answered Prowl quickly. He didn't want to annoy his superior <br />
again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," remarked Optimus. "Now then, I dub thee the Ark!" He banged the <br />
high grade bottle on the wall, but it failed to even give a tiny crack. Optimus looked at <br />
the bottle and banged it again. Still nothing. Annoyance set in and Optimus kept <br />
banging the bottle against the wall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is gonna take a while," predicted Jazz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to get some high grade?" asked Prowl to the group. "I know where the <br />
bar is and there is a replicator that can give Mobian drinks."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, lead the way!" directed Rouge. All members of the ceremony headed to the <br />
bar at four-forward, all except Optimus, who kept his attention on breaking the bottle <br />
against the wall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"BREAK, SLAG YOU!" he shouted.<br />
